## Products and Solutions

### **Hardware Solutions**

B-Plus designs and manufactures a range of high-performance hardware platforms primarily for automotive and industrial applications. Their hardware is central to the development, validation, and deployment of autonomous and automated systems.

#### **Key Hardware Products**

- **ADAS Measurement Platforms:**  
  - *Example: BRICKplus*  
    Enables high-speed, high-capacity data logging from multiple sensors during test drives, supporting the validation of autonomous vehicles and ADAS. The platform is compact, robust, and optimized for handling large data streams[9].
- **Mobile Controllers & Prototyping Platforms:**  
  Used for rapid prototyping and deployment in mobile automation and off-highway vehicles.
- **Automotive Ethernet & IoT Gateways:**  
  Facilitate high-speed communication and data transfer within vehicle networks and between vehicles and external systems.

### **Software Solutions**

B-Plus provides advanced software tools that complement their hardware offerings, focusing on time synchronization, data logging, and system validation for safety-critical automotive applications.

#### **XTSS: Precise Time Synchronization**

- **[[XTSS]]**  
  XTSS is a highly accurate, configurable, and plug-and-play time synchronization solution, critical for ADAS and autonomous driving validation. It ensures all sensor data across distributed systems are precisely timestamped and synchronized, forming the basis for reliable sensor fusion and safety certification. XTSS supports industry standards such as gPTP (IEEE 802.1AS) and PTP (IEEE 1588v2-Industrial Profile), and integrates seamlessly with B-Plus's AVETO platforms[6][9].

#### **Additional Software and Tools**

- **Development Tools for ECU Validation:**  
  Software platforms for validating electronic control units (ECUs) in compliance with ISO 26262, supporting both hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) and software-in-the-loop (SiL) testing[1][2].
- **Visualization Frameworks:**  
  Tools for real-time visualization, cross-sensor calibration, and analysis of large-scale sensor data streams, often used in conjunction with B-Plus hardware and third-party solutions like Luxoft’s C.FRAME[9].

## Notable Collaborations and Recognition

- **Partnership with Luxoft:**  
  B-Plus and Luxoft have collaborated to enhance automotive data logging and visualization, notably in the Ego-mover project, which leverages B-Plus’s BRICKplus and XTSS technologies for continuous, reliable data collection in autonomous vehicle testing[9].
- **Awards:**  
  In 2019, B-Plus GmbH was recognized as one of "Bavaria's Best 50" fastest-growing owner-managed medium-sized companies by the Bavarian State Ministry of Economic Affairs[2].
