# üõ†Ô∏è G-code: Introduction & Overview

## üìö What is G-code?

**G-code** (also known as **RS-274**) is the **standard language used to control CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines**, such as mills, lathes, 3D printers, laser cutters, and other automated manufacturing tools. It's a **low-level, imperative language** that sends precise instructions to machines about movement, speed, tool usage, and operations.

G-code is often the final output of a **CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)** workflow and serves as a direct interface between design (CAD) and fabrication.

## üìê What Can G-code Do?

- Move machine tools along X, Y, and Z axes
- Control feed rates, spindle speeds, coolant, etc.
- Switch tools and manage tool paths
- Engage specific functions (e.g., drilling, cutting, heating, probing)
- Pause or stop operations based on conditions
- Embed metadata or subroutines (in more advanced versions)

| Language         | Used In                      | Abstraction Level | Human Readable | Standardized | Typical Use                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| **G-code**        | CNC machines, 3D printers     | Low               | Yes            | RS-274        | Machining, fabrication               |
| **HPGL**          | Plotters                      | Medium            | Semi           | HPGL          | Pen plotting                         |
| **PostScript**    | Printing                      | High              | No             | Yes           | 2D printing, typesetting             |

## üî¢ Example G-code Commands (NO CODE YET)

- `G0` ‚Äì Rapid movement
- `G1` ‚Äì Linear movement at a controlled feed rate
- `M3` ‚Äì Spindle on (clockwise)
- `M5` ‚Äì Spindle off
- `G28` ‚Äì Return to home position

> These will be explored in future files.

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Modal Commands**: Some commands remain active until changed (e.g., G1 stays in effect).
- **Coordinate Systems**: Machines may use absolute (`G90`) or relative (`G91`) positioning.
- **Machine Variants**: Not all machines implement G-code the same way. Some have vendor-specific codes or macros.
- **Tool Offsets and Compensation**: Critical in multi-tool setups.
- **Preprocessors/Postprocessors**: Modify G-code to fit specific machines or workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Standards and Extensions

- **RS-274-D**: The most common flavor of G-code.
- **ISO 6983**: International standard based on RS-274.
- **Vendor Extensions**:
  - Marlin (3D printers)
  - GRBL (CNC motion controller)
  - Fanuc (widely used in industrial CNC)
