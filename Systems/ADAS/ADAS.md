# 🧠 Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)

## 📝 Overview

**ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems)** are electronic systems in vehicles that use advanced technologies to assist the driver. These systems aim to increase safety and improve the overall driving experience by automating, adapting, or enhancing certain functions.

ADAS is a key stepping stone toward **fully autonomous driving**, but many components are also found in traditional consumer vehicles.

## 🧩 Core Goals

- 🛡️ **Improve Road Safety**: Prevent accidents through early warnings or active interventions.
- 🧭 **Enhance Driver Comfort**: Reduce driver fatigue via automation and assistance.
- ⚙️ **Enable Autonomy**: Serve as foundational components for autonomous vehicle systems (L2–L5).

## 🏗️ Key Functional Categories

### 🛑 Active Safety

- **Forward Collision Warning (FCW)**
- **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)**
- **Lane Departure Warning (LDW)**
- **Blind Spot Detection (BSD)**
- **Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)**

### 🎯 Driver Assistance

- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**
- **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)**
- **Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)**
- **Automatic Parking**
- **Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS)**

### 🔄 Perception and Fusion

- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from LiDAR, radar, camera, ultrasound.
- **Object Detection**: Vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, lane lines.
- **Environment Mapping**: SLAM, semantic maps.
