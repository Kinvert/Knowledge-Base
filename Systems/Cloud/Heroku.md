# Heroku

**Heroku** is a popular cloud [[PaaS]] (Platform-as-a-Service) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It abstracts infrastructure management by providing easy deployment, scaling, and monitoring for web applications and services. Heroku is widely used for rapid prototyping, small-to-medium web apps, APIs, and backend services‚Äîincluding robotics web dashboards, microservices, and AI model hosting.

---

## üìö Overview

Heroku supports many programming languages via [[Heroku Buildpacks]] including Python (e.g., Django, Flask), Node.js, Ruby, Java, Go, PHP, and more. Its git-based deployment model makes it simple to push changes, while add-ons provide managed databases, caching, logging, monitoring, and messaging. Heroku manages runtime, scaling, load balancing, and security, so developers can focus on code.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **[[Heroku Dynos]]**: Lightweight Linux containers running your application processes.
- **[[Heroku Buildpacks]]**: Scripts that prepare the environment and dependencies per language.
- **[[Heroku Add-ons]]**: Managed third-party services (databases, caches, logging).
- **Git-based Deploy**: Deploy apps via `git push heroku main`.
- **Procfile**: Defines process types (web, worker) and startup commands.
- **[[Heroku CLI]]**: Command-line tool to manage apps, add-ons, logs, scaling.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Hosting web applications or [[REST API]]s (e.g., Django, Flask, Express.js)
- Running backend microservices for robotics fleet management or telemetry
- Prototyping and testing new robotic web frontends or dashboards
- Deploying lightweight AI model APIs (e.g., TensorFlow Serving wrappers)
- Integrating databases and caches with minimal setup

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- **Ease of use:** Simple git-based deployment workflow
- **Multi-language support:** Official and community buildpacks for many languages
- **Scalability:** Easily scale dynos up/down or horizontally
- **Managed services:** Add-ons for Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.
- **Free tier:** Good for experimentation and small projects
- **Integration:** Works well with CI/CD, GitHub, Docker, and popular dev tools
- **Security:** Managed SSL, automatic OS patching, and platform security

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- **Cost:** Can become expensive as you scale or add add-ons
- **Limited control:** Abstracts infrastructure, less customizable than raw cloud VMs or Kubernetes
- **Dyno sleeping:** Free-tier apps ‚Äúsleep‚Äù after inactivity causing cold starts
- **Not ideal for stateful workloads:** Primarily designed for stateless web apps
- **Limited GPU support:** Not suited for heavy AI model training or large-scale robotics compute
