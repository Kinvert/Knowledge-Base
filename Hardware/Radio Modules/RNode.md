# RNode

RNode is a series of robust, open-source LoRa (Long Range) radio devices created by unsigned.io, designed to enable resilient, encrypted, and long-distance communication in mesh networks. These devices are especially well-suited for use with [[Meshtastic]] and [[Reticulum]] networking stacks, and they are engineered with higher build quality, greater RF output power, and more durable enclosures than typical hobby-grade LoRa boards. They are often used in scenarios where reliability, portability, and security are critical.

---

## üõ† Overview
RNode devices integrate high-performance LoRa transceivers with rugged hardware and flexible firmware options, supporting both experimental and field-ready communication solutions. They are available in multiple form factors ‚Äî handheld, portable micro units, and stationary desktop models ‚Äî with varying frequency bands and power output levels.

## üìö Core Concepts
- **LoRa Modulation**: Utilizes Chirp Spread Spectrum for long-range, low-power wireless communication.
- **Mesh Networking**: Natively compatible with [[Meshtastic]] and [[Reticulum]] to form peer-to-peer or multi-hop networks.
- **Encryption**: Built-in support for secure communication protocols.
- **Frequency Bands**: Models for 433 MHz, 868 MHz, and 915 MHz, depending on region.
- **High Output Power**: Up to 1 W (with respect to legal limits per region).
- **Field Durability**: Designed for harsh environments with reinforced casing.
