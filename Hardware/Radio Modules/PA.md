# PA (Power Amplifier)

A Power Amplifier (PA) is an electronic device that increases the power level of a radio frequency (RF) signal, enabling it to be transmitted over longer distances or to drive higher-power loads. PAs are critical components in wireless communication systems, radar, broadcasting, and many embedded RF applications.

## ⚙️ Overview

Power Amplifiers take a low-level input RF signal and boost its amplitude without significantly distorting the waveform. They are typically placed at the output stage of a transmitter to ensure the signal is strong enough to reach the intended receiver. The design of a PA involves trade-offs between gain, linearity, efficiency, bandwidth, and output power.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Gain** – Ratio of output power to input power, usually expressed in dB.
- **Linearity** – Ability to amplify without distorting the signal; important for complex modulations.
- **Efficiency** – How well the amplifier converts DC power into RF output power.
- **Classes of Operation**:
  - **Class A** – High linearity, low efficiency.
  - **Class B/AB** – Balanced linearity and efficiency.
  - **Class C** – High efficiency, low linearity; used in narrowband signals.
  - **Class D/E/F** – Switching amplifiers with very high efficiency, often used in digital RF.
- **Saturation Power** – Maximum output power before distortion or clipping occurs.
- **Impedance Matching** – Ensures maximum power transfer between PA and antenna/load.
- **Thermal Management** – PAs dissipate significant heat; cooling is critical.
