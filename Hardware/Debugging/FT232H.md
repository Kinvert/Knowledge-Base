# üü© FT232H

**FT232H** is a USB-to-multipurpose serial interface chip by FTDI. Unlike typical FTDI chips focused solely on UART, the FT232H offers **a range of protocols** including SPI, I2C, GPIO, and JTAG, making it a powerful bridge between a host computer and embedded hardware.

---

## üß† Summary

- Versatile USB-to-serial converter.
- Supports **SPI**, **I2C**, **UART**, **JTAG**, and **GPIO**.
- Often used for scripting communication with chips and sensors.
- Well-supported in Python using [[pyftdi]].

## üõ†Ô∏è Compatible Tools & Libraries

- [[pyftdi]] (pure Python, very popular)
- libftdi (C library)
- OpenOCD (for JTAG via MPSSE)
- Sigrok (limited support)

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Flexible: one device for many protocols.
- Great Python support with `pyftdi`.
- Stable drivers and strong community.
- Doesn't require root on Linux with correct udev rules.
