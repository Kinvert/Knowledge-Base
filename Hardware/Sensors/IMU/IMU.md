# üß≠ IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)

## üß≠ Overview

An **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** is an electronic sensor device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes magnetic field. IMUs are fundamental components in robotics, drones, vehicles, smartphones, and navigation systems, providing essential data for motion tracking, orientation, and sensor fusion.

IMUs typically combine multiple sensor types‚Äîaccelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers‚Äîinto a single module to provide comprehensive motion and orientation information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Multi-Axis Sensing**: Measures acceleration (linear motion), angular velocity (rotation), and sometimes magnetic field (heading).
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from multiple sensors for improved accuracy and stability.
- **Compact and Integrated**: Available as small modules or chips for easy integration into embedded systems.
- **Real-Time Data**: Provides high-frequency, low-latency measurements suitable for control and navigation.

## üß© Typical IMU Components

- **Accelerometer**: Measures linear acceleration along X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Gyroscope**: Measures angular velocity (rate of rotation) around X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Magnetometer** (optional): Measures magnetic field for heading/orientation (sometimes called a 9-DOF IMU).
