# üü£ Gyroscopes (Hobbyist-Friendly)

**Gyroscopes** measure angular velocity (the rate of rotation) around one or more axes. In hobbyist robotics, drones, and embedded systems, small MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) gyroscopes are widely used as standalone devices or as part of an **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**.

This note focuses on gyroscopes and IMUs that are affordable, accessible, and easy to integrate with microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi).

## üß† Summary

- **MEMS gyroscopes** are compact, low-power, and inexpensive.
- Typically used for orientation estimation, motion tracking, stabilization (e.g. in drones, robots, cameras).
- Often combined with accelerometers and magnetometers in IMUs for better drift correction.
