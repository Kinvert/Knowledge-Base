# Sensor Networks

Sensor Networks are interconnected collections of spatially distributed sensor nodes that collaboratively monitor and record physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, pressure, motion, or light. These networks are fundamental in robotics, IoT, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.

## üß† Overview

Sensor networks consist of autonomous sensor nodes communicating wirelessly or wired to share data and coordinate sensing tasks. They enable scalable and distributed monitoring with often limited power, bandwidth, and processing resources, requiring efficient protocols and architectures.

## üß∞ Key Features

- Large-scale deployment of sensor nodes
- Wireless communication (e.g., [[Zigbee]], Bluetooth Mesh, LoRa)
- Data aggregation and filtering to reduce communication overhead
- Energy-efficient operation for battery-powered nodes
- Self-healing and fault tolerance capabilities
- Support for time synchronization and localization
- Often mesh or star network topologies
