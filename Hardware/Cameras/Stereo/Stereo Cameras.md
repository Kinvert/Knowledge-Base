# üëÄ Stereo Cameras

**Stereo Cameras** are vision systems that use two or more image sensors placed at known distances apart to estimate depth information. By mimicking human binocular vision, stereo cameras capture images from slightly different perspectives and compute disparity to infer 3D structure in the scene.

## üß† Summary

Stereo cameras are a key part of many [[Computer Vision]] and [[Robotics]] systems, especially for tasks like [[SLAM]], [[Visual Odometry]], [[3D Reconstruction]], and [[Obstacle Avoidance]].

They are widely used in:

- Autonomous vehicles
- Drones and UAVs
- Robotics (e.g., manipulation and navigation)
- AR/VR applications
- Research and education

## üß™ How Stereo Vision Works

1. **Image Capture**: Two (or more) cameras capture the same scene from slightly different horizontal positions.
2. **Calibration**: Intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each camera are determined (focal length, distortion, baseline, etc.).
3. **Rectification**: Images are aligned so that epipolar lines are horizontal.
4. **Disparity Map**: Difference in the location of the same object in both images is computed (disparity).
5. **Depth Estimation**: Using the disparity and known baseline/focal length, a depth map is generated.

## üíº Industrial (More Expensive) Example

| Model                        | Resolution          | Interface   | Depth Range   | Software Support             | Notes                                  |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Stereolabs ZED 2i**       | 2K/1080p/720p        | USB 3.0     | 0.2 ‚Äì 20m      | ZED SDK, ROS, Unity, OpenCV  | High accuracy, IMU/Barometer onboard   |

> üß† Note: The **ZED 2i** is a common reference in research and industry but significantly more expensive ($400‚Äì$700+). Most hobbyists stick to RealSense or OAK-D level cameras.
