# üì∏ Global Shutter

**Global Shutter** is a camera sensor technology where all pixels in the sensor array are exposed to light **simultaneously** and then read out, as opposed to **rolling shutter**, which reads out rows sequentially. This technology is essential in applications requiring accurate motion capture without distortion.

---

## üß† Summary

- All pixels are exposed at the **same instant**.
- Prevents **motion artifacts** like skew, wobble, or partial exposure (seen in rolling shutter).
- Crucial in high-speed imaging, robotics, machine vision, drones, and SLAM.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- The sensor accumulates light across all pixels at the same time.
- After exposure, the data is transferred to a storage register and read out.
- Can use a **mechanical** or **electronic** implementation.
- Requires **dedicated hardware** per pixel for simultaneous capture and buffering, which increases cost and power.

## üì∑ Stereo and Multi-Camera Systems

Global shutter is often used in systems like:
- [[Arducam Camarray]] with `OV9281`
- [[OV9281 Global Shutter Mono Stereo]]
- [[StereoPi]] (with appropriate sensors)
- [[e-Con Systems Tara.X]]
- [[Luxonis OAK-D]]

These systems require **precise synchronization** and **no distortion**, which global shutter provides.
