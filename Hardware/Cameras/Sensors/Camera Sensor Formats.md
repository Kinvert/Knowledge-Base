# üì∏ Camera Sensor Formats in Robotics and SBCs

This document provides an overview and comparison of popular **camera sensors and formats** frequently used in **robotics**, **embedded systems**, and **single-board computers** such as [[Raspberry Pi]], [[Jetson Family]], and others.

These sensors are often found in MIPI CSI-2 ribbon-based cameras and are critical for applications in Computer Vision, SLAM, Depth Estimation, and real-time robotics.
