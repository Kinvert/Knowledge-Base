# Camera Sensor Aggregators ‚Äî MIPI CSI-2 (CamArray / CrossLink / MultiCam)

Camera **sensor aggregators** (aka camera bridges, multi-camera aggregators, sensor mux/merge boards) let you connect more image sensors to a host with a limited number of MIPI CSI-2 ports. They appear in robotics and edge-vision systems when you need more cameras than the SoC provides, or when you need hardware-level synchronization across multiple sensors (e.g., 4 √ó OV9281 global-shutter cameras). This note focuses on off-the-shelf options (and the reference designs behind them) that work with **CSI-2 ribbon cables** used on Raspberry Pi (CM / RPi 5 family) and NVIDIA Jetson boards, plus practical integration tips for robotics projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick TL;DR

- **Aggregator vs multiplexer:** a *multiplexer* switches/selects one camera at a time. An *aggregator/bridge* merges or stitches multiple CSI-2 streams (via MIPI Virtual Channels or side-by-side stitching) into one CSI-2 output the host sees as a single camera. Use aggregators for simultaneous capture; use multiplexers when sequential sampling is sufficient.  
- **Best off-the-shelf pick for 4√ó OV9281 synchronized capture:** Arducam CamArray / Quadrascopic kits and some e-con Systems / Connect Tech multi-camera solutions. Lattice CrossLink-NX is the common FPGA backbone for custom aggregator designs.  
- **Interfaces:** look for ‚Äú4 √ó 2-lane‚Äù or ‚Äú4 √ó 4-lane‚Äù physical inputs and a single CSI-2 output (or a carrier board with multiple CSI connectors). Jetson/CM connectors expect CSI-2 ribbons or custom coax/GMSL solutions with serdes.  
- **When you need GMSL / FPD-Link instead:** long cables, PoC (power over coax), automotive-grade links ‚Äî vendors like Connect Tech and e-con provide GMSL platforms that guarantee simultaneous frames over long runs.

## üß≠ Core Concepts (short)

- **MIPI CSI-2 Virtual Channels (VC):** lets multiple sensor streams share the same physical CSI link by tagging packets with a VC ID; aggregation can be performed by the bridge/FPGA.  
- **Side-by-side stitch vs VC merge:** stitch merges pixel data to form a larger frame; VC merge sends interleaved packets and requires host or ISP to demultiplex.  
- **Hardware sync (frame-sync / trigger):** to get truly simultaneous exposures, pick sensors with a hardware sync/trigger pin (OV9281 supports sync) **and** use an aggregator/hat that either passes the sync or drives a shared clock.  
- **PHY lanes:** sensors can be 1/2/4-lane. Ensure your aggregator and host lanes (and bandwidth) match your resolution & FPS need.

## üî¨ How it works ‚Äî typical aggregator block

1. Each camera ‚Üí MIPI D-PHY receiver on aggregator FPGA (or serdes receiver for GMSL).  
2. Pixel/line/frame alignment + optional ISP/byte-to-pixel handling.  
3. Virtual channel tagging or side-by-side packaging.  
4. Single CSI-2 transmitter to host (or multiple outputs when supported).  
5. Control plane: I¬≤C/CCI pass-through or aggregator acts as a camera hub (camera registers accessible through the bridge).

## ‚úÖ When to pick which

- Use **Arducam CamArray** or **e-con** if you want *out-of-the-box* 4-camera synchronized capture with CSI-2 ribbons on RPi / Jetson (good for prototyping & robotics).  
- Use **Leopard Imaging** carriers if your Jetson has extra lanes and you just need to bring more physical connectors to the carrier board (not an aggregator).  
- Use **Lattice CrossLink-NX** (reference design or custom board) when you need compact low-power custom aggregation (side-by-side stitching or VC aggregation) for production.  
- Use **GMSL/FPD-Link** (Connect Tech / e-con solutions) if you need **long cable lengths / PoC / automotive** robustness and guaranteed sync across distance.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros / Cons (aggregators in general)

Pros
- Simultaneous capture across many sensors (when combined with sensor sync).  
- Host sees one logical device ‚Äî simpler application layer if aggregator stitches frames.  
- Low-latency pass-through options exist (especially with CrossLink).

Cons
- Complexity: device tree + driver + libcamera adjustments on Jetson / RPi.  
- Bandwidth limits: watch lane count, resolution, framerate and host ISP/DMAs.  
- Signal integrity & cable length: CSI-2 ribbons are short; long runs need serdes (GMSL).  
- Heat & power: many sensors + aggregator + SoC processing can increase system power.

## üîé Synchronization (getting *all* 4 frames at the same time)

Checklist:
- Choose sensors with **hardware frame sync / trigger** support (OV9281 does).
- Ensure aggregator either *passes* the sync or *drives* it; CamArray default synchronized mode handles sync for supported modules.
- Confirm host ISP/driver will accept the aggregated stream (some aggregators present stitched frames as one big camera; others present multiple virtual channels). Lattice CrossLink reference designs support both VC merge and side-by-side stitching; choose the method your ISP can handle.
- If you need absolute deterministic exposure timing across sensors (for stereo depth or motion capture), use an external hardware trigger and confirm the sensors‚Äô exposure timing and readout latency match.

## üîå Physical & Software integration notes (Jetson & Raspberry Pi 5)

- **Jetson boards:** check lane availability ‚Äî Orin/NX boards commonly expose up to 8 lanes (so two 4-lane cameras or four 2-lane cameras). Use carrier/adapters that match lane counts.
- **Raspberry Pi 5 / Compute Module:** Pi5 has dual CSI connectors (and new smaller connectors) ‚Äî Arducam provides adapter/config docs for RPi 5 compatibility; CamArray and Arducam adapters have worked on RPi family with config changes.
- **Drivers:** expect to work with libcamera/picamera2 on Raspbian; on Jetson you‚Äôll work with the L4T device tree + V4L2 bindings and vendor drivers for complex aggregator modes (some vendors provide kernel patches).

---

## üîé Price & Power (estimates & ranges)

- **Arducam Quad OV9281 bundle**: commonly listed ~$200‚Äì$350 for 4√ó kit (camera modules + CamArray HAT). Exact kit price varies by sensor (mono vs color) and reseller. Power: users report ~0.8 W for 4√ó OV9281 + HAT (sensors are ~0.16 W each); aggregator/FPGA add only small overhead.
- **Leopard Imaging LI-JXAV-MIPI-ADPT-4CAM**: board only ‚âà $169 (adapter/carrier price seen on product page). Passive adapter ‚Äî low power.
- **e-con synchronized 4-camera kits**: range from a few hundred to >‚Ç¨800 depending on sensor resolution and features (their high-res kits are pricier).
- **Connect Tech GMSL platforms**: board/platform costs often ‚Ç¨400+, plus per-camera module (~$199 sample price for some NileCAM modules). GMSL adds serializer power but gains long-cable & PoC benefits.
- **Custom CrossLink-NX solution**: upfront dev cost + board BOM; production BOM varies, but CrossLink-NX is positioned as low-power ‚Äî plenty of demos show <1.5 W in certain video pipelines.

## üß∞ Developer Tools & SW ecosystem

- **Reference IP / Designs:** Lattice CrossLink-NX offers N:1 MIPI CSI-2 camera aggregator reference designs (VC merge / stitch) and source packages. Good starting point for custom boards.
- **V4L2 / libcamera / device tree:** you‚Äôll likely need device tree edits, custom driver overlays, or vendor kernel modules on Jetson/RPi. Check vendor docs first (Arducam / e-con / Leopard provide guides).
- **FPGA dev:** CrossLink-NX evaluation boards and IP bundles (Lattice Diamond / Nexus toolchain) are the path for bespoke aggregation features.

## üß≠ Use-case examples

- **Robotics perception rig (4 √ó OV9281 monochrome global-shutter):** Arducam CamArray kit for rapid prototyping; synchronize frames for stereo/depth algorithms.
- **Industrial inspection (4 √ó high-res sensors at 60+ FPS):** e-con Systems synchronized kit or custom CrossLink-NX aggregator feeding Jetson AGX Orin / Xavier with sufficient bandwidth.
- **Autonomous vehicle / long-cable cameras:** GMSL/FPD-Link with Connect Tech or OEM GMSL boards; PoC + guaranteed sync over meters of coax.

## ‚úÖ Quick checklist before buying

1. Confirm **host CSI lanes** / ISP capability.  
2. Match **sensor lanes** (2-lane OV9281 is common) and aggregator lane output.  
3. Confirm **synchronization method** ‚Äî hardware trigger vs virtual channel stitching.  
4. Check vendor **driver support** for your OS and JetPack / RPi OS version.  
5. Consider cable length ‚Äî otherwise prefer GMSL for long runs.  
6. Budget for power & thermal headroom on host board (Jetson boards already run hot).
