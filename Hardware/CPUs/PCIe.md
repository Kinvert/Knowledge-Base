# PCIe

**PCI Express (PCIe)** is a high-speed serial expansion bus standard used to connect various hardware components directly to the CPU and motherboard. It is critical in robotics, AI/ML, and high-performance engineering systems, as it connects **GPUs**, **NVMe storage**, **FPGAs**, **network cards**, and more.

The number of lanes (e.g., x1, x4, x8, x16) and generation (Gen 3, Gen 4, Gen 5, Gen 6) determine bandwidth and performance characteristics. PCIe is integral to system throughput, especially when transferring large amounts of data between accelerators and the CPU.

## üß† Overview

- **Lane-based architecture**: Each lane has two pairs of wires (send + receive)  
- **Full-duplex communication** per lane  
- **Backward and forward compatible** with most modern motherboards  
- Core interconnect for **GPUs**, **NVMe SSDs**, **capture cards**, **NICs**, and more  
- Evolves rapidly with newer generations offering double the bandwidth of the previous

## üìä PCIe Versions Comparison

| Generation | Year | Bandwidth / Lane (x1) | Bandwidth (x16) | Typical Use Cases                |
|------------|------|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| PCIe 3.0   | 2010 | 1 GB/s                 | 16 GB/s          | GPUs, SSDs, general peripherals  |
| PCIe 4.0   | 2017 | 2 GB/s                 | 32 GB/s          | High-speed SSDs, ML accelerators |
| PCIe 5.0   | 2019 | 4 GB/s                 | 64 GB/s          | AI/ML, data center GPUs          |
| PCIe 6.0   | 2022 | 8 GB/s                 | 128 GB/s         | Future AI, simulation clusters   |

*Bandwidth figures are per direction (full-duplex). Actual throughput may be lower depending on device/controller overhead.*
