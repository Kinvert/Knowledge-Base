# CPUs

A **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a system. In engineering, robotics, AI/ML, and simulation-heavy fields, the CPU is critical for handling control loops, preprocessing, simulation, numerical computation, and orchestration of other components like GPUs, memory, and sensors.

CPUs come in various architectures and core configurations, with modern multi-core and multi-threaded CPUs being capable of parallel workloads essential to performance-critical applications in robotics and simulation.

## üß† Overview

- Executes instructions defined by software  
- Coordinates memory, input/output, and peripheral devices  
- Handles sequential and parallel processing workloads  
- Dominates in tasks where **branching, logic, and task switching** are common  
- Often used in tandem with [[GPUs]] for compute-intensive tasks

## üß™ Use Cases in Engineering and Robotics

- Compiling software (e.g. [[CMake]], ROS2 builds)  
- Running real-time control systems on [[RTOS]]  
- Numerical simulations (e.g. FEM, CFD, or system dynamics)  
- Interfacing with sensors and actuators via communication buses (e.g. EtherCAT)  
- CPU-bound ML workloads or preprocessing pipelines  
- Orchestrating multi-agent RL training environments

## üß∞ Categories of CPUs

- **Desktop CPUs**: High performance, general-purpose (e.g., [[Ryzen 9 9950X]], Intel Core i9)
- **Mobile CPUs**: Power efficient, found in laptops and embedded devices
- **Server CPUs**: Optimized for parallelism and memory bandwidth (e.g., AMD EPYC, Intel Xeon)
- **HEDT (High-End Desktop)**: Bridge between desktop and server CPUs (e.g., [[Threadripper 7960X]])
- **Embedded CPUs**: Used in microcontrollers and low-power robotics (e.g. ARM Cortex series)
