# TCA9548A

The **TCA9548A** is an 8-channel I²C switch/multiplexer developed by Texas Instruments. It allows a single master I²C bus to be expanded into multiple downstream channels, each independently selectable. This is particularly useful in robotics and embedded systems where multiple I²C devices with fixed addresses (such as identical sensors) need to coexist without conflict.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

The TCA9548A works by routing the SDA and SCL lines from the master to one or more downstream channels. It is controlled through its own I²C interface, where the master writes to the TCA9548A to select which channels are active. This enables flexible bus management, isolation, and address conflict resolution.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **I²C Multiplexing**: Routes master SDA/SCL to multiple selectable downstream channels.  
- **Address Conflict Resolution**: Allows identical sensors (same fixed I²C address) to operate on separate channels.  
- **Independent Channels**: Up to 8 channels can be enabled individually or in combination.  
- **Cascading**: Multiple TCA9548A devices can be used for large I²C topologies.  
- **Low On-Resistance**: Ensures minimal signal degradation across channels.
