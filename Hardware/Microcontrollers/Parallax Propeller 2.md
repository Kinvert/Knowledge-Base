# Parallax Propeller 2

The Parallax Propeller 2 is a unique 32-bit multicore microcontroller designed for parallel processing, real-time I/O, and deterministic execution. With 8 symmetrical cores ("cogs"), it allows developers to run independent tasks concurrently, making it well-suited for complex timing-critical applications in robotics, signal processing, and control systems.

---

## üß† Overview

Unlike traditional microcontrollers that rely on a central core and interrupts, the Propeller 2 executes multiple threads independently in hardware, each with its own scheduler and resources. This design enables efficient, deterministic handling of time-sensitive tasks without complex real-time operating systems or interrupt management.
