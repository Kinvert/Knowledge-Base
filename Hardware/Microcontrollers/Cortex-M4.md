# Cortex-M4

The Cortex-M4 is a 32-bit processor core from ARM designed for deterministic, real-time embedded systems. It builds upon the Cortex-M3 architecture with added DSP instructions and an optional floating-point unit (FPU), making it ideal for digital signal control in robotics, audio processing, motor control, and low-power applications.

## üìö Overview

Introduced as a mid-performance core in ARM's Cortex-M series, the M4 balances efficiency and computational power. It‚Äôs especially suited for embedded systems requiring both control and signal processing, enabling tasks like PID control, FFTs, and sensor fusion without needing an external DSP.
