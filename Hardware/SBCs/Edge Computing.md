# üåê Edge Computing

**Edge Computing** refers to the practice of performing data processing close to the source of data ‚Äî at the "edge" of the network ‚Äî rather than in a centralized cloud or data center. It is especially useful in applications requiring **low latency**, **offline capabilities**, or **bandwidth conservation**.

---

## üß† Summary

- Processes data **locally** on edge devices (e.g., sensors, gateways, embedded computers)
- Reduces reliance on cloud or central servers
- Enables **real-time responses**, even with limited connectivity
- Common in **IoT**, **autonomous systems**, **smart manufacturing**, and **retail**
