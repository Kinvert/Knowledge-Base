## üß† Summary

- Original Nano boards were based on the **Maxwell GPU** and are entry-level AI boards.
- The **Orin Nano** boards are based on the **Ampere GPU architecture** and are significantly more powerful ‚Äî bridging the gap to mid-tier Jetson boards like Xavier NX.
- The "Super Dev Kit" term is often used informally to describe the **Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit**, which is a more complete package with better cooling and more ports.
