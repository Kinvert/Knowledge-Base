## üé• Jetson Family Camera Interface Comparison

This section focuses on the Jetson modules' camera capabilities, particularly **CSI-2 lane count**, **ribbon cable support**, and **compatibility with common camera modules** like IMX219, IMX477, Arducam, and others. Camera support is a crucial factor in vision-based AI applications.

### üß† Notes on Interface

- **CSI Lanes**: Each camera sensor may use 2 or 4 lanes depending on resolution and FPS.
- **15-pin vs 22-pin**: 15-pin is common on older Pis and Jetsons; newer Jetsons and cameras are switching to 22-pin for 4-lane support.
- **Camera Support**: JetPack versions affect supported cameras‚Äîsome newer sensors require JetPack 5+.
