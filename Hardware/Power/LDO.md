# LDO (Low Dropout Regulator)

Low Dropout Regulators (LDOs) are linear voltage regulators that provide a stable, low-noise output voltage while requiring only a small difference between input and output voltages. They are especially important in mixed-signal and robotics systems where clean power rails are necessary for sensitive analog and RF circuits.

## ⚙️ Overview

An LDO regulates voltage by dissipating excess energy as heat, using a pass transistor and feedback control loop. Unlike switching regulators, LDOs do not introduce high-frequency switching noise, making them well-suited for analog, sensor, and RF domains.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Dropout Voltage**: Minimum difference required between input and output for regulation  
- **PSRR (Power Supply Rejection Ratio)**: Ability to suppress ripple/noise from input supply  
- **Load Regulation**: Stability of output voltage under varying load currents  
- **Quiescent Current (Iq)**: Current consumed internally by the regulator itself  
- **Transient Response**: How quickly the regulator responds to load changes
