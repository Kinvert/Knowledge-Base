# IOVDD (I/O Voltage Supply)

IOVDD refers to the dedicated power rail that supplies voltage to the digital input/output (I/O) pins of an integrated circuit. Unlike analog or core voltage domains, IOVDD specifically defines the voltage level used for communication interfaces and determines the logic thresholds for signals exchanged with external devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Modern ICs often separate power domains (Core, Analog, and I/O) to balance performance, noise isolation, and compatibility with external logic.  
- **Core voltage**: Powers the internal logic (e.g., 1.0V‚Äì1.2V).  
- **AVDD**: Provides a clean rail for analog and mixed-signal blocks.  
- **IOVDD**: Defines the voltage level for digital signal interfacing (e.g., 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V).  

This separation allows chips to interface with different standards while protecting sensitive analog or core domains.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Voltage Domain Matching**: IOVDD sets the logic-high level for GPIO, UART, SPI, I¬≤C, and other interfaces.  
- **Level Shifting**: Necessary when different devices operate at mismatched I/O voltages.  
- **Isolation**: Prevents digital switching noise from contaminating analog domains.  
- **Flexibility**: Multiple IOVDD rails can allow multi-voltage I/O banks for compatibility.
