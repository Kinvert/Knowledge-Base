# DroneForge Nimbus üåÄ

A developer-focused overview of **DroneForge Nimbus** (the Nimbus SDK / Nimbus app) as a platform for building autonomous / pilotless drone systems ‚Äî emphasising radio/receiver compatibility (ELRS / CRSF / Crossfire / others), integration with small whoops like the **BETAFPV Air65**, OS/runtime support (Ubuntu vs vendor OS), telemetry/range/latency characteristics, and practical compatibility notes for engineers.

---

## üîé Overview
DroneForge "Nimbus" is an SDK + desktop app for building, testing and deploying AI-enhanced drone behaviors. It explicitly targets ELRS (ExpressLRS) radio links and CRSF/serial integration, provides real-time video panels with AI overlays (YOLO, monocular depth), a node-based visual flow (NimbusMap), telemetry/link statistics, and an 8-channel RC interface for control/override. The SDK ships releases/ AppImage builds for Linux and desktop platforms and exposes serial port (CP210x) integration for connecting physical hardware.

---

## üìù Summary
- **Primary integration:** ExpressLRS / CRSF (full support shown in the Nimbus README).
- **Channels:** UI shows 8-channel display (ROLL, PITCH, THROTTLE, YAW + AUX) and supports channel hardcoding/override.
- **OS/Run modes:** Nimbus provides Linux AppImage releases and instructions to run on typical Linux machines (e.g., Ubuntu) ‚Äî connecting over USB (CP210x) or serial. In short: **yes, it runs on standard Ubuntu** (AppImage / .sh launcher usage suggested in README).
- **Target hardware:** ELRS-enabled receivers and flight controllers using CRSF/SBUS/serial outputs; small drones like the BetaFPV Air65 (which commonly ships with integrated Serial ELRS/CRSF RX) are explicitly compatible in practice.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts
- **ELRS (ExpressLRS):** open-source radio link (2.4GHz / 900MHz) supporting FLRC/LoRa modes, extremely configurable packet rates (up to 1000Hz in 2.4GHz FLRC), telemetry and CRSF serial output for flight controllers. Nimbus uses CRSF framing to talk to the receiver/FC.
- **CRSF (Crossfire serial protocol):** popular serial transport used by Crossfire and supported as the receiver‚ÜíFC serial output by many ELRS receivers ‚Äî low-latency channels + telemetry packets. Nimbus explicitly notes CRSF integration.
- **Telemetry & Control Flow:** Nimbus collects RSSI, SNR, link quality, and channel values; it can overlay AI outputs on FPV and also send channel overrides to the FC (i.e., autopilot/closed-loop control).

---

## üî¨ How it works (high level)
1. **Physical link:** an ELRS receiver on the drone receives radio link from a compatible TX (ExpressLRS module / TX or TBS Crossfire etc), then outputs serial (often CRSF) to FC/OSD stack. Nimbus listens to CRSF packets via a USB serial interface (e.g., CP210x from a connected module or via a flight-controller passthrough). 
2. **Telemetry & channels:** ELRS transmits channels + telemetry; the FC can provide additional telemetry via MSP/MAVLink which ELRS can pack into telemetry bursts. Nimbus shows link stats and can log them.
3. **AI + control:** Nimbus runs vision stacks (ONNX/YOLO) locally, computes target/positioning, and writes channel overrides or higher-level setpoints to the FC via CRSF / serial; it also visualises video and depth overlays.

---

## üì° Compatible radios & receivers (practical list)
> **Primary**: ExpressLRS-compatible receivers (ELRS Nano, ELRS Nano VTX combos, ELRS-enabled 5-in-1 boards), because Nimbus explicitly targets ELRS and CRSF.

- **ExpressLRS (ELRS) receivers** ‚Äî ELRS Nano, ELRS R9 variants, many modern ELRS RX boards. These provide CRSF serial output or SBUS/other outputs (selectable / hardware dependent). ELRS supports multiple output protocols (CRSF, SBUS, SUMD, SmartAudio, etc).
- **Betaflight-style 5-in-1 FCs with Serial ELRS** ‚Äî e.g., the BetaFPV Air brushless FC integrates a *Serial ELRS 2.4G RX* that outputs CRSF to the FC. Nimbus can interface with such setups (via serial passthrough or direct USB).
- **TBS Crossfire / CRSF receivers** ‚Äî Crossfire uses CRSF for FC telemetry/control; Nimbus supports CRSF-level integration, so CRSF receivers are usable where serial is available. Note Crossfire TX modules are proprietary hardware; Crossfire and ELRS both can produce CRSF for FCs but are different radio links. 
- **Other protocols** (less direct): you can convert other RX outputs (PWM/SBUS/FPort) to serial/CRSF on the FC side ‚Äî Nimbus depends on serial CRSF visibility for many of its UI features. ELRS receivers can often be configured to output SBUS or CRSF depending on hardware.

---

## üß≠ Supported drone sizes / examples
- **Whoops / micro (28‚Äì75 mm wheelbase):** BetaFPV Air65 (65 mm) ‚Äî integrated ELRS receiver and tiny 5-in-1 FC make it straightforward to use Nimbus for higher-level AI/telemetry and channel overrides. Nimbus's focus on ELRS/CRSF and small-device telemetry suits micro/whoop form factors where integrated serial RX is present. 
- **Racing / Freestyle micros and minis (3‚Äì5 inch):** Any FC that exposes CRSF via a serial port and connects to an ELRS/Crossfire RX will be compatible. Nimbus expects a serial-visible CRSF stream (or passthrough mode) to provide live channel values.
- **Larger platforms ( > 5 inch / long-range):** As long as the airframe contains an ELRS/Crossfire receiver that outputs CRSF to the flight stack, Nimbus can interface for high-level commands/telemetry. For heavy autopilot demands, Nimbus is best used as a companion/control plane rather than replacing a certified autopilot.

---

## üì∂ Range / Bandwidth / Latency ‚Äî practical expectations
> These values are determined primarily by the radio link (ELRS or Crossfire) and hardware configuration, not by Nimbus itself.

- **ExpressLRS (ELRS):**
  - **Latency:** configurable by packet rate. ELRS supports very high refresh (up to 1000 Hz on some 2.4 GHz setups). In practice, pilots run 50‚Äì500 Hz depending on range/conditions; higher packet rates lower latency. ELRS community reports sub-5ms to few-ms link latencies at high packet rates in optimal setups. 
  - **Range:** extremely variable ‚Äî with high-gain antennas and high-power modules, experienced users report 10s of kilometers in ideal conditions; ELRS emphasizes both long-range and high refresh flexibility. Realistic hobbyist ranges: hundreds of meters to many kilometers depending on antenna/tx power/regulatory limits.
  - **Telemetry bandwidth:** ELRS exposes configurable telemetry bursts (LINK vs DATA) and shares bandwidth with MSP/MAVLink if used. Bandwidth is sufficient for channel transport and periodic telemetry; advanced telemetry allocation is configurable.
- **TBS Crossfire:**
  - **Latency:** historically very low and consistent; marketed for "ultra-low latency" with high telemetry bandwidth. Crossfire typically has slightly higher base-latency than high-rate ELRS modes but remains low enough for precise control. Practical latency figures vary (~few ms to tens of ms depending on mode/config).
  - **Range:** designed for very long range (many pilots report multiple kilometers to tens of kilometers with high power modules/antenna setups).

> **Bottom line:** Nimbus inherits whatever latency/range your radio link provides. For low-latency closed-loop AI control (fast maneuvers), run ELRS at a high packet rate (333‚Äì1000Hz where supported) and ensure the FC/OS path latency (serial/processing) is minimized.

## üîó Signals sent in & out (protocols & payloads)
- **Inbound to Nimbus (observed):**
  - CRSF channel packets (channel values, stick positions).
  - Telemetry packets (RSSI, SNR, link stats, possibly FC telemetry forwarded via ELRS telemetry).
  - FPV video stream (Nimbus expects a live video feed for AI overlays ‚Äî typically via capture device).
- **Outbound from Nimbus (control / commands):**
  - CRSF channel overrides (writing channel values) and possibly direct serial commands to FC via MSP/MAVLink if configured. Nimbus documents channel hardcoding and override features.
- **Other:** ELRS telemetry can encapsulate Flight Controller telemetry (MSP/MAVLink) via passthrough; Nimbus can surface these stats in its telemetry panels.

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths (where Nimbus shines)
- Tight ELRS/CRSF integration (native support for link metrics and channel streaming).
- Built-in AI pipelines (YOLO, depth estimation) and visual node-based programming (NimbusMap) for non-trivial autonomy experiments.
- Desktop-centric developer UX (AppImage on Linux, serial port picker, live overlays, data export).
---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses / Caveats
- **Early-stage / proprietary maturity:** repo shows early releases; API docs are "work in progress". For production-grade autonomy, validate safety/failsafe behavior independently.
- **Radio dependence:** the functional capabilities (latency, telemetry richness) are highly dependent on the chosen TX/RX hardware and settings (ELRS vs Crossfire etc). Nimbus cannot improve raw RF physics.
- **Limited community-project examples (so far):** few public third-party projects currently reference Nimbus by name ‚Äî expect to prototype and debug integration yourself.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros / Cons (concise)
- **Pros:** ELRS-first SDK, real-time AI overlays, Linux desktop AppImage, CRSF channel control, telemetry/logging.
- **Cons:** Early docs/API maturity, dependency on serial passthrough for some features, limited known community integrations/examples.

## üß© Variants & Releases
- Releases include Linux AppImage GPU-enabled builds; check the GitHub Releases for the latest AppImage and release notes (e.g., Nimbus v0.2.0). Nimbus repo contains `droneforge-crsf-service` and other support components.

---

## üîß Developer Tools & Installation notes
- **Prereqs:** OpenCV 4.x, ONNX Runtime (for AI models), CUDA/toolkit for GPU acceleration where applicable. Nimbus README emphasizes these.
- **Linux run:** download AppImage or run bundled script; README suggests `./Droneforge-Nimbus-<version>.AppImage` or run the `droneforge_nimbus.sh` launcher on Linux/Ubuntu. Use a proper data-capable USB-C cable and select CP210x serial at 115200 for device port.
- **Connecting to an FC / RX:** If using a BetaFPV Air65 or similar, enable serial passthrough or connect to the FC UART configured for CRSF/MSP. Many modern BetaFPV boards expose the Serial ELRS RX directly to FC.

---

## üß™ Examples / Projects found
- **Official repo samples / releases:** Nimbus SDK repo includes example assets and a `droneforge-crsf-service`. Releases show "run the AppImage; plug in Nimbus USB-C; select CP210x" style instructions (see repo releases).
- **Third-party adoption:** as of searches, public third-party projects referencing Nimbus SDK are limited; mostly the project is early and community examples are scarce ‚Äî you may need to prototype. (No extensive third-party project list found in public search results.)

## ‚úÖ Key takeaways (quick)
- Nimbus is ELRS/CRSF-first: **best compatibility** is with ExpressLRS receivers (ELRS Nano / serial ELRS) and any FC that exposes CRSF or a serial passthrough.
- **Runs on Ubuntu/Linux** via AppImage / shell wrapper; it does not require a proprietary "Omarchy" OS ‚Äî you can run on standard Ubuntu desktops that meet prerequisites (OpenCV, ONNX runtime, drivers).
- **Works well with BetaFPV Air65** and similar whoops that include integrated Serial ELRS RX outputs; bigger platforms are supported provided they have ELRS/CRSF serial visibility to Nimbus.

---

## üßæ Notes about safety & productionization
- Nimbus can send channel overrides ‚Äî **test in a safe environment** and implement robust failsafes on the FC (geofencing, arming checks, hardware kill) before any untethered/autonomous flights. Always comply with local UAV regulations.
