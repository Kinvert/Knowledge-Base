# BETAFPV ELRS Air65 ‚Äî Deep Dive (Air65)

The **BETAFPV Air65 (ELRS)** is a modern ultra-light 65 mm whoop designed for FPV fun, racing, and as a tiny research/learning platform. The Air65 ships with a highly-integrated ‚ÄúAir‚Äù 5-in-1 flight controller (FC+ESC+OSD+VTX+Serial-ELRS RX), runs Betaflight firmware out of the box, and is available in different motor/prop configurations (Racing, Freestyle, Champion). This note is a practical, engineer-focused reference: how to get one flying, what radios work, how to approach autonomy (ROS2 / PX4 / ArduPilot), how to use PufferLib for training, how to integrate with DroneForge Nimbus, and realistic upgrade paths for ‚Äúself-flying‚Äù experiments.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick TL;DR (what you can do with an Air65)
- **Out of the box:** Fly FPV with ExpressLRS (ELRS) radio control and Betaflight‚Äôs flight modes (Angle, Horizon, Acro). Great for manual or assisted flights.
- **Autonomy options (realistic):**  
  1. *Lightweight experiments* ‚Äî vision-based/human-in-the-loop approaches by streaming video to a ground computer and sending RC stick commands (or using ELRS to carry commands).  
  2. *Serious autonomy* ‚Äî swap to a PX4/ArduPilot-compatible autopilot (or add a companion computer + MAVLink-capable autopilot) to run missions/ROS2 stacks. PX4/ROS2 has robust offboard interfaces for autonomy.
- **Radio:** ELRS transmitter or module required to use integrated ELRS receiver; you can also wire in an external receiver (SBUS/SRXL/SPEKTRUM) to the FC if you prefer another radio ecosystem.

## üß≠ What‚Äôs in the Air65 (hardware & firmware)

**Key hardware (typical ELRS Air65 BNF / AIO variants):**
- Frame: Air65 ultralight canopy/frame (‚âà 65 mm wheelbase).
- Flight Controller / ESC: BetaFPV **Air Brushless Flight Controller (G4 / STM32G473)** 5-in-1 AIO (FC + 1S ESCs + integrated OSD + integrated VTX + *Serial ELRS receiver* on the 5IN1 variant). ICM42688P gyro, STM32G473 MCU, 16 MB Blackbox. Runs **Betaflight** (BetaFPV recommends Betaflight 4.x builds for Air G4).
- Camera: C03 (or similar micro FPV) and onboard VTX (25‚Äì400 mW selectable).
- Radio link: integrated **Serial ELRS 2.4 GHz** (ExpressLRS) on the 5IN1 variant; firmware V3.x in many shipping units (bind phrase/firmware must match TX). The serial ELRS receiver talks CRSF over UART to the FC.

---

## üõí Minimal shopping / parts checklist (to get flying right away)
- Air65 (ELRS 5-in-1 variant) ‚Äî BNF (bind-and-fly) for quick start.
- ELRS TX: a radio with built-in ELRS or an external ELRS TX module (examples: RadioMaster with ELRS module, Jumper / Radiomaster radios, LiteRadio 2 SE with ELRS option). See ExpressLRS quick-start for module wiring/flashing.
- FPV goggles / monitor that accept analog 5.8 GHz input (if using analog VTX)  
- Batteries: 1S Z-folding or micro LiPo (as specified by BetaFPV for flight time)  
- Charger and small toolkit (precision screwdriver, soldering iron optional)  
- Optional: a micro-USB cable, Betaflight Configurator on your laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux) for setup and tuning.

## üîå Radios & ELRS ‚Äî what you need to know

### Do you need a radio to fly it?
Yes ‚Äî the Air65 includes an ELRS serial receiver (5IN1 variant) so **an ELRS transmitter (TX)** or TX module is required for RF control. If you don‚Äôt have an ELRS TX you must either:
- attach an external receiver compatible with your existing radio (via one of the FC UARTs: SBUS/CRSF/SBUS-in), or  
- replace/disable the internal ELRS and add a serial Spektrum/SBUS receiver, or  
- get an ELRS TX module for your existing radio.

### Which radios / modules work?
- **ExpressLRS (ELRS)** is the native link (2.4 GHz or 915/868 MHz options). Popular choices: RadioMaster family (TX16S, TX12) with ELRS modules, Jumper T-Pro/T-Lite with ELRS module, LiteRadio 2 SE (BETAFPV), Radiomaster Ranger, TBS CRSF/Tango 2 (Crossfire) alternatives if you swap RX. ExpressLRS docs and community strongly recommend using matched ELRS versions and binding phrases.
- **Spektrum radios**: you **can** use a Spektrum radio *with the Air65* ‚Äî but not by binding it to the Air65‚Äôs integrated ELRS RX. Instead you would add a small Spektrum-compatible receiver (SRXL/SRXL2/DSM-satellite) and wire it to a spare UART/SBUS input on the Air FC, then configure Betaflight to use that receiver. Spektrum also has tiny serial receivers (SRXL2/serial micro) that connect over a single data wire and are supported by flight stacks that accept serial receivers. See vendor docs for wiring and binding details.

## üõ†Ô∏è First-time setup (practical step-by-step)

1. **Unpack & inspect**: look for the 5IN1 FC variant if you want built-in ELRS; check canopy and connectors.
2. **Charge battery** and bench-power the Air65 for the first time to verify VTX and camera power up. Use a bench strap for props OFF testing.  
3. **Bind ELRS**: power the quad on/off 3√ó (or follow BetaFPV bind procedure) and put your ELRS TX in bind mode. BetaFPV mentions power-cycling for internal serial ELRS bind mode. You can also update ELRS receiver firmware via Wi-Fi (some BetaFPV units) or through Betaflight serial passthrough + ExpressLRS Configurator.
4. **Connect to Betaflight Configurator**: plug micro-USB, open Betaflight Configurator (Desktop), confirm `Receiver` tab shows channels (set `Serial` + provider `CRSF` for the integrated ELRS). BetaFPV recommends specific Betaflight versions for Air G4 family (see BetaFPV support).
5. **Set flight modes**: configure an arm switch, Angle (self-level) for safe flights, and a failsafe config. Do a simple bench test of motors and ESC direction.  
6. **PID / rates**: start with BetaFPV recommended CLI file/firmware settings (they provide .hex and recommended CLI). Fine-tune later outdoors.

## üß© Will it work with DroneForge Nimbus & how?

**Short answer:** *Yes ‚Äî but with conditions.* DroneForge Nimbus is positioned as a hardware-agnostic SDK/platform for deployable drone AI; their SDK and product pages indicate integrations with ELRS and common flight stacks. For practical integration you have two common paths:

1. **Companion-computer + PX4 (recommended path for autonomy & Nimbus)**  

2. **Radio/ELRS command injection (edge case)**  
   - If you want to keep the tiny Air65 hull and still run high-level autonomy, you can run Nimbus agents on a ground or companion computer and send control by emulating RC inputs (e.g., inject stick commands into an ELRS TX module or use a telemetry/command channel). This is doable but fragile and latency-sensitive; it‚Äôs a pragmatic hack for very light tiny whoops that cannot carry a companion computer. Use only for low-risk experiments.

**Practical steps** (high level):
- Decide whether you‚Äôll **(A)** add PX4/ArduPilot autopilot and run Nimbus / ROS2 offboard via MAVLink, or **(B)** keep Betaflight & use an external computer to send RC commands into an ELRS TX module. Option A is cleaner for robust autonomy.

---

## üß† How to make it ‚Äúfly itself‚Äù ‚Äî realistic options (ranked)

### 0) Beginner / lightweight (no hardware change)
- Use Betaflight self-level (`Angle`) and tune `Rates/PID`. Not true autonomy ‚Äî good for safety and assisted flight.

### 1) Vision-assisted / ground-based autonomy (practical for tiny whoops)
- Run a perception stack on a ground computer (YOLO, optical flow), estimate target/pose, send *stick commands* from the ground over ELRS (or over a telemetry radio). This lets you implement simple following behaviours w/o adding weight. Latency and safety are big caveats.

### 2) Companion computer + offboard (recommended for research)
- Replace or augment FC with a PX4-capable autopilot (or add a companion computer that connects to a PX4 via MAVLink). Run **ROS2** + perception/planning (or DroneForge Nimbus) on the companion computer, use **MAVROS / MAVSDK** to command offboard setpoints. This is the standard research stack for real autonomy.

### 3) Full autopilot path (best for robust autonomy)
- Use a proper autopilot (Pixhawk / CUAV / Holybro) on a larger frame, use PX4/ArduPilot for GPS/RTK/mission planning, and connect ROS2 via MAVROS or px4-ros2 bridge. This is how industry and serious research teams do autonomous missions.

## üîÅ PufferLib + Air65 ‚Äî what is feasible & how to integrate

**PufferLib** is an RL/experiment tooling and training library (excellent for simulation training). Typical workflow to use PufferLib with a drone:

1. **Train in simulation** ‚Äî use PufferLib with an environment that simulates your drone dynamics (Gym/Gazebo/IsaacSim). Train a policy (e.g., observation ‚Üí throttle/roll/pitch/yaw or higher-level velocity commands).
2. **Sim2Real transfer** ‚Äî use domain randomization, dynamics randomization, and closed-loop tests in hardware-in-the-loop.  
3. **Deployment** ‚Äî export the model (`TorchScript`/ONNX) and run it on a companion computer. The companion sends offboard setpoints to PX4 (via MAVROS/MAVSDK) or generates RC stick values and pushes them into the radio. For Air65 specifically, you must either (A) provide a companion computer on the drone (hard due to weight), (B) run the policy on a ground laptop and stream commands, or (C) move to a slightly larger frame that can carry a Jetson/NVIDIA board for onboard inference.

**Bottom line:** PufferLib is excellent for the *training/simulation* side ‚Äî deployment requires careful hardware choices.

## üìä Comparison chart ‚Äî Air65 vs peers (whoops + autonomy choices)

| Model / Class | Type | Weight (nominal) | FC (native) | Native Autonomy fit | Good for learning autonomy? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **BETAFPV Air65 (ELRS)** | 65 mm whoop | ~17 g (no battery) | Air G4 5IN1 (G473) + Serial ELRS | Low ‚Äî Betaflight (no MAVLink). Requires swaps for full autonomy. | Good for perception experiments; poor if you need onboard MAVLink autonomy |

## ‚úÖ Strengths (Air65)
- Extremely light & agile ‚Äî superb low-inertia flight characteristics for learning control and perception.
- Integrated ELRS ‚Äî modern, low-latency link good for frequent control updates.
- Low cost and widely available ‚Äî good for large fleets / many learning trials.

## ‚ùå Weaknesses (Air65)
- Betaflight + tiny FC architecture makes **true autonomous missions (MAVLink, GPS, mission planning) difficult** without hardware changes.
- Very little payload capacity ‚Äî companion computers (Jetson/USB boards) are usually too heavy to mount without changing the frame.  
- Limited GPS/positioning capability in a micro whoop form factor.

---

## üîß Upgrade & modification paths (how to get autonomy)

1. **Add a companion computer on a larger frame** (Jetson Nano/Xavier NX, Raspberry Pi 4): run ROS2 + perception and connect to a PX4 autopilot (via MAVLink) to control vehicle. This is the canonical research setup.
2. **Swap the FC to a PX4/ArduPilot compatible board** (if a physical replacement exists for the Air65 footprint ‚Äî usually not; better is to move to a slightly larger frame that accepts a Pixhawk/Cube). Use PX4 for navigation + MAVROS for ROS2 integration.
3. **Use ground-side autonomy + RC injection**: run autonomy on a ground PC and stream RC channel commands into your transmitter (or implement a small UART->radio link). This keeps the tiny hull but is less robust.  
4. **Optical flow / VIO + tiny autopilot**: research teams sometimes use optical-flow sensors (PX4Flow style) + VIO stacks for GPS-less indoor position hold ‚Äî but this is heavy on sensors and calibration.

---

## üßæ Practical setup notes & gotchas
- **ELRS versions matter**: receiver and TX should run compatible major ELRS releases and the same regulatory domain/bind phrase. BetaFPV often ships RX with a default ELRS V3 build ‚Äî update via ExpressLRS Configurator if needed.
- **Serial receiver binding on internal ELRS**: BetaFPV documents entering bind mode by cycling power 3√ó and using Betaflight passthrough to flash RX firmware if required.
- **Betaflight vs MAVLink**: don‚Äôt expect Betaflight to be a drop-in for MAVLink/ROS2 mission workflows. It‚Äôs optimized for human-piloted FPV; autonomous research workflows favor PX4/ArduPilot.

## üèÅ Key takeaways / recommended path if your goal = **self-flying farm drone swarm**
1. **Prototype perception/control in simulation** (PufferLib + Gazebo/IsaacSim) and iterate quickly.
2. **Use a platform that supports MAVLink & companion computer** (Pixhawk/Cube on 3" or larger frames) for realistic ROS2 + PX4 integration ‚Äî this is the standard production/research path.
3. **Use Air65 / other tiny whoops for low-weight vision/edge prototyping** (perception, low-latency experiments, swarming ideas) ‚Äî but accept the hardware limits for carrying a computer or running PX4.
4. **If you must keep tiny whoop frames**: implement autonomy by ground-side compute + RC injection, or consider ultra-light companion devices (experimental) ‚Äî but expect reliability limitations.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick checklists (copy/paste friendly)

**Initial bench setup**
- `Install Betaflight Configurator`  
- `Connect Air65 via USB` ‚Üí validate FC recognized  
- `Receiver tab` ‚Üí set `Serial` mode and `Serial Receiver Provider = CRSF` (for internal ELRS)  
- `Modes` ‚Üí add Arm + Angle (safe)  
- `PID` ‚Üí load BetaFPV recommended CLI if provided

**To add ROS2 autonomy (recommended minimal stack)**
- Get a PX4-compatible FC (Pixhawk family) + companion computer (Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS2 Humble or later)  
- On companion: install `mavros` / `mavsdk` and connect via serial/UDP to autopilot  
- Use ROS2 nodes for perception/planning and publish offboard setpoints (see PX4 ROS2 offboard examples).

---

## üß≠ Final notes (practical judgment)
The Air65 is an **excellent tiny FPV platform** ‚Äî light, fun, and modern (ELRS). For **research/production autonomy** (ROS2, mission planning, robust offboard control), you will either need to (A) move to a larger frame that accepts a Pixhawk/Cube and companion computer, or (B) accept brittle, ground-based tricks for commanding the tiny whoop. Use Air65 for perception and control experiments where weight matters; use Pixhawk/PX4 for full autonomy and ROS2 integration.
