# üü® FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)

**FPGA** stands for **Field-Programmable Gate Array**, a type of integrated circuit that can be **programmed after manufacturing** to implement custom digital logic. Unlike microcontrollers or CPUs, FPGAs do not execute instructions sequentially‚Äîthey instead perform computation through **configurable hardware blocks** wired together to form custom circuits.

## üß† Summary

- Hardware description is typically written in **HDL** (Hardware Description Language) like **Verilog** or **VHDL**.
- Enables parallelism and determinism at the hardware level.
- Used for applications requiring **high performance**, **low latency**, or **precise timing control**.
