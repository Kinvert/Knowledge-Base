# CrossLink-NX (Lattice CrossLink-NX FPGA)

Lattice **CrossLink-NX** is a low-power FPGA family optimized for embedded vision, camera/display bridging, and **sensor aggregation** (combining multiple MIPI [[CSI-2]] streams into one). Built on the Nexus platform (28 nm FD-SOI), it targets applications where you need hardened [[D-PHY]] blocks, tiny packages, fast I/O, and deterministic, low-latency data movement between sensors and processors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

- **Domain**: Embedded vision, robotics, automotive, edge AI pre/post-processing  
- **Why it exists**: To bridge/aggregate/duplicate camera streams and offload light vision tasks before an SoC/ISP/CPU/GPU sees the data  
- **Signature features**: Up to **two hardened 4-lane MIPI D-PHY** (TX/RX), soft D-PHY on GPIO for extra lanes, small packages, low power, robust SER figures; 17 K‚Äì40 K logic-cell class devices and family variants (including CrossLinkU-NX with hard USB).

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Hardened MIPI**: Native D-PHY blocks reduce power and ease timing vs ‚Äúsoft D-PHY‚Äù on regular I/O.
- **Sensor Aggregation**: Merge N camera streams into one CSI-2 output using **Virtual Channels (VCs)** or spatial compositing (side-by-side, tiling), optionally color-convert/resize on-FPGA.
- **Bridging & Duplication**: CSI-2‚ÜîCSI-2, CSI-2‚ÜíHDMI/DSI, display splitting/replication for redundancy.
- **Deterministic Pipelines**: Line/frame-synchronous processing with minimal jitter‚Äîuseful for robotics timestamping and fusion.

---

## üî≠ Common Uses (Robotics & Embedded)

- **Multi-camera rigs** (stereo, surround, 360): 2:1 or 4:1 aggregation to a single AP input using VCs or mosaics  
- **SoC interoperability**: Adapt sensors to APs with fewer CSI-2 ports (e.g., [[Jetson Family]], [[Raspberry Pi]])  
- **Pre-ISP conditioning**: Mux, crop, scale, simple color space ops before ISP/NN accelerator  
- **Automotive ADAS**: Camera fan-in/out, display split/duplication for redundancy and diagnostics

|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| **CrossLink-NX** | **2√ó 4-lane (TX/RX), up to ~10 Gb/s per PHY** | No | 17K‚Äì40K | Camera aggregation/bridging |
| **CrossLink (orig.)** | 2√ó 4-lane (bridge-centric) | No | ~6K | Legacy camera/display bridges |
| **CrossLinkU-NX** | 2√ó 4-lane + soft D-PHY | **USB 2.0 + USB 3.2 Gen 1 (hard)** | 33K | USB cameras/bridges + MIPI |
| **CertusPro-NX** | No hard MIPI (use soft) | No | Up to 100K+ | General purpose, SERDES-heavy |

**Notes**: CrossLink-NX emphasizes embedded MIPI at low power; **CrossLinkU-NX** adds **hard USB 3.2**; ‚Äúorig. CrossLink‚Äù is older bridge silicon. Specs summarized from Lattice product pages and datasheets. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## üß© Comparison Chart ‚Äî Against common low/mid FPGAs

| Device | Hard MIPI D-PHY | Soft D-PHY feasible | Power (qualitative) | Camera Aggregation Fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CrossLink-NX (Lattice)** | **Yes (2√ó 4-lane)** | Yes (HP I/O) | Very low | **Excellent** (native) |
| **ECP5 (Lattice)** | No | Yes | Low | Good (soft IP, tighter margins) |
| **Spartan-7 / Artix-7 (AMD)** | No | Yes | Moderate | Good (needs soft IP/ext PHY) |
| **Cyclone 10 LP (Intel)** | No | Yes | Moderate | Good (soft IP) |
| **PolarFire (Microchip)** | No (usually ext PHY) | Yes | Low-mod | Good (heavier dev effort) |
| **GOWIN GW2A/GW1N** | No | Yes | Low | Fair/Good (soft IP maturity varies) |

**Takeaway**: CrossLink-NX‚Äôs **hardened** D-PHY reduces risk and power for MIPI-heavy designs vs families that rely on soft PHY or external transceivers.

## üßØ Comparison Chart ‚Äî Multi-camera strategies

| Strategy | How it works | Pros | Cons | When to choose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CrossLink-NX VC Aggregation** | Merge multiple CSI-2 inputs to one output via **Virtual Channels** | Single cable/port, time-aligned frames, flexible | FPGA dev needed | When AP lanes/ports are scarce |
| **CrossLink-NX Mosaic/Tiling** | Stitch images (e.g., side-by-side) into one larger frame | Simple downstream processing | Pixel resampling/crop logic | Fixed layouts, bandwidth math |
| **MIPI Switch/Multiplexer** | Time-slice cameras onto one link | Simple hardware | Not simultaneous; pipeline artifacts | Non-concurrent capture tolerated |
| **Many-lane AP (e.g., big Jetson)** | Connect each camera directly | Simplifies design | Cost, power, connector count | If budget/power allow |

**Notes**: Lattice provides VC aggregation and 4:1 examples; time-sliced muxes can cause skewed capture timing (seen in some quad-cam boards).

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Sensor Aggregation)

1. **CSI-2 RX** on hardened D-PHY blocks receives multiple streams  
2. **Align & Tag**: Frames buffered/retimed; assign **Virtual Channels** or spatially compose  
3. **Optional ops**: RAW10‚ÜíRGB888, resize, crop, basic ISP stubs  
4. **CSI-2 TX** outputs one stream to AP (or **HDMI/DSI** bridge path if required)
