# üí† ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)

An **ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)** is a chip designed for a **particular use case or application**, rather than general-purpose computing. Unlike FPGAs which are reconfigurable, ASICs are **fabricated with fixed logic**, optimized for performance, power, or cost for a specific task.

---

## üß† Summary

- Purpose-built integrated circuits tailored for a specific function.
- Used in mass-produced electronics for efficiency and miniaturization.
- Can be far more efficient than general-purpose CPUs or FPGAs once manufactured.
- Fabrication is expensive and time-consuming, making them ideal for **high-volume** applications.

| **RTL Design**     | Write hardware description in [[Verilog]] or [[VHDL]]                   |
| **Simulation**     | Test logic functionality using simulators (e.g., ModelSim, Verilator)   |
| **Synthesis**      | Convert HDL code into gate-level netlist                                |
| **Layout**         | Physical placement/routing of logic blocks                              |
| **Fabrication**    | Send final design to foundry (e.g., TSMC) for manufacturing             |
| **Testing**        | Use test harnesses and JTAG to verify functionality post-fabrication    |
