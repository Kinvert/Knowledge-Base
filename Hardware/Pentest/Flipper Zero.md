# Flipper Zero

## üß† Summary

**Flipper Zero** is a **portable multi-tool for pentesters and hardware hackers**. Designed with a **cyberdolphin-themed Tamagotchi aesthetic**, it blends playful UX with a powerful suite of tools for exploring digital radio protocols, access control systems, hardware interfaces, and more.

Unlike traditional pentesting gear, Flipper Zero is **self-contained**, doesn't require a host computer for most functions, and includes both **transmit** and **sniffing** capabilities across multiple protocols.

## üéØ Key Capabilities

- **Sub-1 GHz RF transceiver** for reading and emulating remote key fobs (garage doors, etc.)
- **125 kHz RFID/NFC support** (read, emulate, write tags)
- **Infrared transceiver** (record and send IR signals for TVs, AC units, etc.)
- **GPIO pins & iButton interface** (for hardware hacking, UART/SPI/I2C debugging, etc.)
- **Bluetooth (via external module)** ‚Äî BLE support in development
- **BadUSB support** (emulates HID devices like keyboards to inject keystrokes)
- **MicroSD card support** for extended storage
- **Community-developed firmware/plugins** (e.g. for brute-forcing or signal replay)
- **Screen + navigation controls** allow standalone use without a smartphone or PC

## üîç Use Cases

- Hardware hacking
- RFID/NFC access emulation
- Garage door fob copying
- IR remote replication
- BadUSB keystroke injection
- Signal replay attacks (when legally permitted)
- Debugging embedded devices via GPIO/UART/SPI
- Educational demonstrations on embedded and wireless security
