# 🧰 Bus Pirate

The **Bus Pirate** is a universal **serial interface hacking tool** that allows for interaction with various **digital communication protocols**. Designed for troubleshooting, development, and reverse engineering of embedded systems, it bridges your computer and low-level buses like **I2C, SPI, UART, and 1-Wire**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- **Developer**: Originally created by Dangerous Prototypes.
- **Main Function**: Acts as a bridge between a computer and embedded devices.
- **Interfaces Supported**:
  - [[I2C]]
  - [[SPI]]
  - [[UART]] / [[RS232]]
  - [[1-Wire]]
  - [[JTAG]] (limited)
  - [[Bit Banging]] of custom protocols

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Use Cases

- Probing unknown embedded devices.
- Communicating with EEPROMs and sensors.
- Dumping firmware from flash memory.
- Testing microcontroller communication.
- Educational tool for learning serial protocols.
- Interfacing with chips via breadboards.

---

## ✅ Strengths

- Supports multiple protocols in one tool.
- Open-source hardware and firmware.
- Affordable and widely available (~$30–50).
- Can perform logic-level signal analysis (to a limited degree).
- Helpful community and large number of user scripts.

---

## ❌ Limitations

- **Slow speed** (compared to modern tools like J-Link or Saleae).
- Interface is **command-line only** (no GUI).
- **Limited memory and buffer size**, making it unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis.
- Not actively maintained in recent years.

## 💻 Software & Interfaces

- Connects via **USB serial**.
- Controlled with a **terminal interface** (e.g., `minicom`, `PuTTY`, `screen`).
- Commands are **ASCII-based**, organized into modes (I2C mode, SPI mode, etc.).
- Can be scripted with Python or bash for automation.

---

## 💡 Compatible Hardware

- EEPROMs (e.g., 24LC256)
- Flash chips
- Sensors (e.g., I2C accelerometers)
- Microcontrollers and dev boards
- Raspberry Pi GPIO (for external debugging)
