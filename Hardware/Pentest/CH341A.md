## üß≠ Notes

- CH341A is great for **flashing SPI/I2C chips**, but Bus Pirate is more for **interactive exploration and debugging**.
- FT232H is ideal for **scripted interfacing and GPIO toggling**.
- J-Link and TL866 are more **targeted tools** for specific embedded workflows like debugging or socket-based programming.
- USBasp is **very specific to AVR** microcontrollers and not general-purpose.
