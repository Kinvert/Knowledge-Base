# Hak5 Pineapple

## 🧠 Summary

The **Hak5 WiFi Pineapple** is a professional wireless auditing and pentesting device. Developed by **Hak5**, it enables **network reconnaissance**, **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks, and **WiFi credential harvesting** by exploiting common client behaviors in wireless networks.

Unlike general-purpose devices like the Flipper Zero, the WiFi Pineapple is specifically built for **wireless attack simulations**, making it a go-to tool for **Red Teaming**, **penetration testing**, and **WiFi security research**.

## 🔍 Key Capabilities

- **Rogue Access Point** creation
- **Karma attacks** (impersonates trusted SSIDs to attract clients)
- **PineAP Suite** (custom MitM attack stack for 802.11)
- **Credential harvesting** via captive portals
- **Packet sniffing** (monitor mode)
- **Automated scanning** and logging of networks and clients
- **Remote command and control** (via web UI or CLI)
- **Module system** to install third-party attack tools (DNS spoofing, deauth, etc.)
- **OpenWRT-based firmware** with full Linux shell access
- **USB-C or battery powered**
- **Access via browser-based interface or SSH**
