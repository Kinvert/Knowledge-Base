# Harmonic Drive

A Harmonic Drive is a specialized type of mechanical gear system known for its high precision, compact size, zero backlash, and high torque capacity. It is widely used in robotics, aerospace, and precision machinery where accurate motion control and repeatability are critical.

Unlike typical gearboxes, harmonic drives use flexible components and wave generators to achieve smooth, high-ratio reduction in a compact form factor.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The harmonic drive consists of three main components:

- **Wave Generator**: An elliptical cam that deforms the flex spline.
- **Flex Spline**: A thin, flexible, cylindrical gear that meshes with the circular spline.
- **Circular Spline**: A rigid internal gear with slightly more teeth than the flex spline.

The wave generator‚Äôs elliptical shape causes the flex spline to engage with the circular spline at two opposite regions, creating a gear reduction through the difference in tooth count.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Zero Backlash**: Eliminates gear lash for highly precise positioning.
- **High Reduction Ratios**: Typically 50:1 to 160:1 in a single stage.
- **Compact and Lightweight**: Ideal for space-constrained robotic joints.
- **High Torque-to-Weight Ratio**: Enables powerful actuation without large motors.
- **Flex Spline Deformation**: Key to harmonic drive operation and durability.
