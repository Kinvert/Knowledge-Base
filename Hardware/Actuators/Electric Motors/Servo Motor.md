# Servo Motor

Servo Motor refers to any motor system that operates under closed-loop feedback to control position, velocity, or torque. While the term is sometimes used ambiguously, in engineering contexts it typically describes a motor (often a [[BLDC]] or [[PMSM]]) paired with sensors (like an [[Encoder]]) and a controller capable of maintaining a desired setpoint via continuous feedback.

Servo systems are foundational to robotics, CNC, and automation, offering high precision, dynamic response, and robust control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

A servo motor is not a distinct type of motor, but rather a **system** that includes:

- A motor (brushed or brushless)
- A position or velocity sensor (e.g., encoder)
- A controller that adjusts current or voltage to maintain a control target

The controller compares the desired value with the actual value and adjusts motor input accordingly ‚Äî a classic closed-loop control system, often implemented with a [[PID Controller]].

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Closed-loop Control**: Continuously compares actual vs. desired value.
- **Position vs. Torque Control**: Servo systems can regulate angle, speed, or force.
- **Backlash and Compliance**: Important in mechanical linkages attached to servos.
- **Bandwidth**: Determines how quickly the system can respond to changes.
- **Gearing**: Often used to trade speed for torque and resolution.
