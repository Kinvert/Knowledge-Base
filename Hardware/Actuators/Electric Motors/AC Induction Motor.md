# AC Induction Motor

AC Induction Motors are one of the most common types of electric motors, widely used in industrial and commercial applications due to their robustness, simplicity, and reliability. They operate by inducing current in the rotor winding through a rotating magnetic field generated by the stator, eliminating the need for brushes or permanent magnets.

Though less common in robotics compared to [[BLDC]] or [[PMSM]], induction motors remain critical in heavy machinery, pumps, fans, and HVAC systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

An AC induction motor consists of:

- **Stator**: Stationary winding supplied with AC power producing a rotating magnetic field.
- **Rotor**: Usually a squirrel-cage design where currents are induced by the stator field.
- **Slip**: The rotor rotates slightly slower than the stator‚Äôs magnetic field, enabling induction.

Speed is controlled by frequency and voltage of the supplied AC, often using Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs).

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Electromagnetic Induction**: Current in rotor windings is induced by the stator‚Äôs rotating magnetic field.
- **Slip**: Difference between synchronous speed of stator field and actual rotor speed; essential for torque production.
- **Squirrel Cage Rotor**: Simple, rugged rotor design without electrical connections.
- **Starting Torque**: Typically lower than other motor types; often assisted with starters or soft-start controls.
- **Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)**: Adjusts AC supply frequency for speed control.
