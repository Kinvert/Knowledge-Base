# Hysteresis Motor

A Hysteresis Motor is a type of synchronous AC motor that uses the magnetic hysteresis property of a specially designed rotor to maintain synchronous speed with the rotating stator magnetic field. It is known for smooth, quiet operation and precise speed control, commonly used in applications requiring constant speed and low vibration, such as precision instruments and timing devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The rotor of a hysteresis motor is made from a hard magnetic material with significant hysteresis loss. When the stator's rotating magnetic field passes through the rotor, it magnetizes the rotor material with a lag (hysteresis), creating a synchronous torque that locks the rotor speed to the stator field frequency.

Because the rotor locks to synchronous speed, these motors provide very stable and constant speed without slip.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Magnetic Hysteresis**: The lagging magnetization in rotor material produces torque.
- **Synchronous Operation**: Rotor rotates at the same speed as stator magnetic field.
- **Rotor Material**: Made from hard magnetic alloys with high coercivity.
- **Torque Production**: Combination of hysteresis and induced eddy currents.
- **Smooth and Quiet**: Minimal vibration and noise due to synchronous speed and uniform torque.
