# Synchronous Motor

A Synchronous Motor is an AC motor in which the rotor rotates at the same frequency as the stator‚Äôs rotating magnetic field. Unlike [[Induction Motor]]s, which exhibit slip, synchronous motors maintain a constant speed under varying load conditions, making them ideal for applications that require precise and consistent rotational speed.

They are widely used in industrial drives, robotics, power factor correction systems, and synchronous clocks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The synchronous motor operates by aligning the magnetic field of the stator with a rotor field that is either generated by DC excitation (via slip rings) or permanent magnets. It runs in synchrony with the input power frequency, typically requiring external circuitry or startup mechanisms since it does not self-start like an induction motor.

Variations include:
- **Wound-rotor Synchronous Motors**
- **Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors ([[PMSM]])**
- **Synchronous Reluctance Motors ([[Synchronous Reluctance Motor]])**

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Synchronous Speed**: Rotor speed is locked to the frequency of the stator‚Äôs magnetic field  
- **No Slip**: Unlike induction motors, there‚Äôs no relative motion between rotor and stator fields once synchronized  
- **DC Excitation or Magnets**: Rotor field can be generated via external excitation or embedded permanent magnets  
- **Torque Angle**: The angle between the rotor field and stator field determines torque  
- **Power Factor Correction**: Synchronous motors can be over-excited to act like capacitors
