# Universal Motor

A Universal Motor is a type of electric motor that can operate on either AC or DC power sources. It combines features of both series-wound DC motors and AC motors, making it versatile and capable of high-speed operation. Universal motors are commonly found in household appliances such as vacuum cleaners, power tools, and kitchen equipment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The universal motor uses a series-wound stator and rotor winding configuration, which allows it to produce high starting torque and operate efficiently on both alternating and direct current. Its compact size and ability to run at high speeds make it suitable for portable devices.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Series Wound**: Field winding and armature winding are connected in series, resulting in high starting torque.
- **AC/DC Operation**: Designed to work with AC or DC by leveraging commutation and magnetic field interactions.
- **Mechanical Commutation**: Uses brushes and a commutator for switching current direction in the rotor.
- **High-Speed Capability**: Can reach speeds up to 20,000 RPM or more.
- **Variable Speed**: Speed can be controlled by varying voltage or using electronic controllers.
