# ESC

ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) is a device that electronically regulates the speed, direction, and braking of an electric motor. It acts as the interface between the power source and the motor, interpreting control signals and switching power transistors to drive the motor accordingly.

ESCs are essential for controlling [[BLDC]] and [[Brushed DC Motor]] types in robotics, drones, and automation. Their design varies based on the motor type, control method (e.g., trapezoidal or sinusoidal), and feedback integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

An ESC modulates power to a motor by switching transistors (typically MOSFETs) rapidly in patterns that generate the desired motor phase currents. In simple cases, this means PWM control. In more advanced ESCs, it includes position estimation, current regulation, and motor commutation.

ESCs for brushless motors must handle three-phase output and either estimate or measure rotor position for proper timing.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **PWM Input**: Most ESCs accept PWM signals (e.g., 1000‚Äì2000 ¬µs pulses) to set speed.
- **3-Phase Commutation**: For brushless motors, ESCs cycle current through 3 phases to create rotation.
- **Sensorless vs. Sensored**: Some ESCs rely on back EMF; others use Hall sensors or encoders.
- **Regenerative Braking**: Some ESCs support energy recovery during deceleration.
- **Timing and Advance**: Adjusting phase advance for better efficiency or speed at different loads.
