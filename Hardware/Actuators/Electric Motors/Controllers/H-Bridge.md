# H-Bridge

An H-Bridge is a fundamental electronic circuit used to control the direction of current through a load, typically a DC motor. It enables bidirectional control‚Äîallowing motors to spin forward or reverse‚Äîby selectively switching high and low voltage paths using transistors or MOSFETs arranged in an ‚ÄúH‚Äù configuration.

H-Bridges are commonly used in robotics, motor drivers, and power electronics, especially with [[Brushed DC Motor]]s and [[Continuous Rotation Servo]]s modified for external motor control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

A basic H-Bridge consists of four switching elements (usually transistors or MOSFETs) configured in a manner that forms the shape of an "H":
- The motor is placed in the center (the crossbar of the "H")
- High-side and low-side switches on each leg allow polarity reversal

Control is achieved by turning on a complementary pair of switches:
- High-left + Low-right ‚Üí forward
- High-right + Low-left ‚Üí reverse
- Both lows or both highs off ‚Üí brake
- All off ‚Üí coast

Advanced H-Bridge ICs may include protections like shoot-through prevention, current sensing, and thermal shutdown.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Bidirectional Motor Control**: Enables motors to spin in both directions  
- **Transistor Switching**: Uses MOSFETs, BJTs, or IGBTs for efficient power control  
- **PWM Speed Control**: Combines with [[PWM]] to regulate speed  
- **Braking and Coasting Modes**: Some implementations support dynamic braking  
- **Shoot-Through Prevention**: Ensures opposite-side switches don‚Äôt short the power supply
