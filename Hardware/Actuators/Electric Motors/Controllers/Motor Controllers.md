# Motor Controllers

Motor Controllers are electronic devices or systems that manage the operation of electric motors by regulating parameters such as speed, torque, direction, and position. They translate input commands from higher-level controllers or user interfaces into electrical signals that drive the motor appropriately.

Motor controllers vary widely in complexity, ranging from simple on/off switches to advanced closed-loop systems implementing sophisticated control algorithms like [[FOC]].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

A motor controller interfaces between the power source, motor, and control system. It can provide:

- **Speed control** through voltage or current modulation (e.g., PWM)
- **Direction control** by switching polarity or commutation sequence
- **Torque control** via current regulation
- **Position control** when combined with feedback devices (encoders, resolvers)

Controllers are designed specifically for motor types such as [[Brushed DC Motor]], [[BLDC]], [[PMSM]], or [[Stepper Motor]] and support various control schemes accordingly.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**: Common technique to control average voltage/current.
- **Closed-loop Control**: Uses feedback (e.g., from [[Encoder]] or [[Current Sensor]]) for precision.
- **Commutation Methods**: Mechanical (brushes) or electronic (sensor-based or sensorless).
- **Protection Features**: Overcurrent, overheating, undervoltage, and stall protection.
- **Communication Interfaces**: CAN, UART, SPI, or analog inputs for command and diagnostics.
