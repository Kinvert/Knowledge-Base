# BLDC

[[BLDC]] (Brushless DC Motor) is a type of electric motor that uses electronic commutation instead of brushes to control current flow through its windings. Known for high efficiency, reliability, and power-to-weight ratio, BLDC motors are widely used in robotics, drones, electric vehicles, and industrial automation.

Their low maintenance requirements and precise controllability make them ideal for applications where performance and durability are critical.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

BLDC motors consist of a rotating permanent magnet rotor and a stationary stator with coils. Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) use position information (from Hall sensors or back EMF) to switch current through the windings at the right time, replacing the mechanical brushes in traditional DC motors.

They can be built in **inrunner** or **outrunner** configurations, impacting torque and speed characteristics.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Electronic Commutation**: Achieved using an ESC, which switches phases based on rotor position.
- **Hall Sensors**: Embedded in the stator to detect rotor position.
- **Sensorless Control**: Uses back EMF instead of Hall sensors for position detection.
- **Kv Rating**: RPM per volt; used to characterize speed performance.
- **Torque Constant (Kt)**: Torque output per amp of current.
- **Field Weakening**: Advanced method to increase top-end RPM at reduced torque.
