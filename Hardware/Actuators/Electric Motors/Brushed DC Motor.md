# Brushed DC Motor

Brushed DC motors are simple and widely-used electric motors that operate using mechanical commutation via carbon brushes and a commutator. They are known for their ease of use, low cost, and compatibility with direct voltage sources, making them a common choice in hobby robotics, small actuators, and early automation systems.

Though largely supplanted by [[BLDC]] and [[PMSM]] motors in advanced applications, brushed motors remain relevant in systems where simplicity, cost, or legacy hardware are priorities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

A brushed DC motor consists of:

- A rotor (armature) with windings
- A stator with permanent magnets or electromagnets
- Brushes that contact a rotating commutator to switch current direction in the rotor

This internal switching maintains torque in the same direction and allows continuous rotation. Speed is typically controlled by adjusting the supply voltage or using PWM.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Mechanical Commutation**: Brushes and commutator physically reverse current to maintain torque direction.
- **PWM Speed Control**: Varying duty cycle to adjust average voltage and speed.
- **Brushed vs. Brushless**: Brushed motors are simpler but wear out faster due to mechanical contact.
- **Voltage-Torque Relationship**: Output torque is proportional to current; speed is proportional to voltage.
