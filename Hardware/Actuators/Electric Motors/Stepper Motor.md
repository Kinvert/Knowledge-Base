# Stepper Motor

Stepper motors are electromechanical actuators that move in discrete steps rather than continuous rotation. Their ability to hold position without feedback makes them ideal for open-loop control in applications requiring precise positioning, repeatability, and simplicity ‚Äî such as CNC machines, 3D printers, and pick-and-place systems.

Unlike continuous-rotation motors, stepper motors increment in fixed angular steps, typically 1.8¬∞ per step (200 steps/rev), though microstepping can improve resolution and smoothness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Stepper motors divide a full rotation into a fixed number of steps, making them inherently suitable for digital control. Each input pulse advances the shaft by a known angle, allowing control systems to move to exact positions without requiring encoders in many cases.

They are especially well-suited for tasks where speed is moderate, torque is predictable, and the motion path is known in advance.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Step Angle**: The angular distance per pulse, often 1.8¬∞ or 0.9¬∞.
- **Microstepping**: Intermediate current levels create finer positioning steps.
- **Open-loop Control**: Operates without position feedback; low complexity.
- **Holding Torque**: Ability to resist external force when powered but not moving.
- **Resonance**: Mechanical vibration at certain frequencies, may require damping.
