# Synchronous Reluctance Motor

A Synchronous Reluctance Motor (SynRM) is an AC motor that produces torque through the magnetic reluctance principle, where the rotor aligns with the stator‚Äôs rotating magnetic field to minimize magnetic reluctance. Unlike permanent magnet motors, SynRMs do not use magnets or windings on the rotor, offering a cost-effective, robust, and magnet-free synchronous motor solution.

SynRMs are gaining attention in industrial and automotive applications for their efficiency and reduced reliance on rare-earth materials.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The rotor of a SynRM has salient poles with varying magnetic reluctance. When energized, the stator‚Äôs rotating magnetic field causes the rotor to align along the path of least reluctance, generating synchronous torque.

Speed is synchronous with the stator‚Äôs magnetic field frequency, requiring precise control methods typically involving inverters and feedback.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Magnetic Reluctance**: Rotor torque is generated by tendency to align with minimum magnetic reluctance path.
- **Synchronous Operation**: Rotor rotates at the same speed as the stator‚Äôs rotating magnetic field.
- **Salient Pole Rotor**: Rotor design features anisotropic magnetic paths creating varying reluctance.
- **No Permanent Magnets**: Avoids cost and supply risks associated with rare-earth magnets.
- **Control**: Requires inverter drives with control algorithms such as [[FOC]] for smooth operation.
