# Piezoelectric Motor

A Piezoelectric Motor is a type of electric motor that generates motion through the deformation of piezoelectric materials when subjected to an electric field. Unlike electromagnetic motors, piezoelectric motors use ultrasonic vibrations or stepping actions to produce precise and controllable movements, often at micro- or nano-scale.

These motors are widely used in precision positioning, optics, medical devices, and applications requiring compact size and high resolution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Piezoelectric motors utilize the piezoelectric effect, where certain ceramics change shape when an electric voltage is applied. By rapidly applying voltage sequences, the motor creates mechanical motion through friction or stepping mechanisms, often without traditional rotating parts.

Common types include ultrasonic motors, stick-slip motors, and inchworm motors.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Piezoelectric Effect**: Electric voltage causes mechanical strain in certain materials.
- **Ultrasonic Vibration**: High-frequency vibrations induce continuous motion via friction.
- **Stick-Slip Motion**: Slow expansion followed by rapid contraction to produce incremental steps.
- **Non-Magnetic Operation**: Ideal for environments sensitive to magnetic fields.
- **High Precision**: Capable of sub-micron positioning accuracy.
