# Electric Motors

Electric motors are electromechanical devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical motion. They are critical to virtually all robotics systems, from hobbyist rovers to industrial automation arms and autonomous drones. Motors come in many types, each optimized for specific requirements such as torque, speed, size, efficiency, control precision, or durability.

Understanding the full landscape of motor types and how they compare is essential for making informed design choices in robotics, mechatronics, and embedded systems.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Commutation**: Determines how current is applied to windings (mechanical vs. electronic).
- **Back EMF**: Voltage generated by the motor as it turns; used for feedback and control.
- **Torque Constant (Kt)**: Relates torque output to current input.
- **Speed Constant (Kv)**: Relates RPM to voltage.
- **Stall Torque**: Max torque with zero speed; important for load-starting applications.
- **Efficiency Curve**: How well the motor converts input power to output motion at various loads.
- **Control Methods**: PWM, Field Oriented Control (FOC), 6-step commutation, V/Hz control, etc.
