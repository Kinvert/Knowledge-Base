# Switched Reluctance Motor

A Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) is a type of electric motor that operates by switching current through stator windings to align the rotor with the lowest magnetic reluctance path. It features a simple and robust construction with no magnets or windings on the rotor, making it ideal for high-speed, high-temperature, and harsh-environment applications.

SRMs are gaining renewed interest in EVs, industrial drives, and aerospace due to their fault tolerance and independence from rare-earth materials.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The stator of an SRM contains concentrated windings, while the rotor is a simple laminated steel structure with salient poles but no windings or magnets. Torque is produced by energizing stator phases in a sequence that pulls the rotor toward the position of least magnetic reluctance.

Precise timing of phase switching is critical and is handled by a dedicated controller.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Magnetic Reluctance**: Rotor moves to minimize the magnetic resistance between stator and rotor.
- **Salient Pole Rotor**: Rotor consists of protruding poles without coils or magnets.
- **Unipolar Drive**: Current flows in one direction per phase; simpler power electronics.
- **Discrete Phase Commutation**: Phases are energized in sequence to produce continuous torque.
- **Independent from Rare Earths**: No need for permanent magnets.
