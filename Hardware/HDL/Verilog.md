# üßæ Verilog

**Verilog** is a **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** used to model and describe digital systems, including FPGAs and ASICs. It's used to express **Register-Transfer Level (RTL)** logic and simulate the behavior of circuits before they're synthesized into physical hardware.

---

## üß† Summary

- Created in the 1980s and standardized as IEEE 1364.
- Describes **combinational and sequential logic**.
- Used for **digital design**, **simulation**, and **synthesis**.
- Similar to C in syntax, making it approachable for software developers.

## üìö Key Concepts

| Concept            | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `module`           | Building block that defines logic and ports                              |
| `wire` vs `reg`    | `wire` for combinational, `reg` for sequential assignments               |
| `always` blocks    | For continuous or edge-triggered logic (e.g., clocks)                    |
| `assign`           | Used for continuous assignments to `wire`s                               |
| `initial` blocks   | Set up test conditions in simulations (not synthesized into hardware)    |

## üß™ Common Verilog Constructs (No Code Blocks)

- `module` and `endmodule` define a circuit
- `always @ (posedge clk)` handles clocked logic
- `assign` used for continuous combinational logic
- `if` / `else`, `case`, and `for` statements for logic control
