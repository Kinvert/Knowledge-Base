# Fanout Buffer

A **Fanout Buffer** is an electronic component or circuit used to distribute a single input signal to multiple outputs without significant degradation in signal integrity. In robotics and embedded systems, fanout buffers ensure that multiple devices or subsystems can reliably receive the same timing or control signals, especially in high-speed or high-load environments.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

Fanout buffers take a single source signal and replicate it across multiple outputs. This helps prevent loading issues, reduces signal skew, and maintains signal integrity when driving multiple downstream circuits. They are particularly important in clock distribution networks, FPGA systems, and robotics platforms with synchronized components.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Fanout**: The number of inputs that a single output can reliably drive.
- **Buffering**: Strengthening a signal to drive multiple loads without distortion.
- **Skew Control**: Ensuring minimal delay differences between outputs.
- **Signal Integrity**: Maintaining clean voltage levels despite multiple connections.
- **Clock Distribution**: A common application for fanout buffers in robotics and computing.
