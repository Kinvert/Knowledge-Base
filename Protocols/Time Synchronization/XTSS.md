## üß© XTSS Components

XTSS comprises two main services:

### 1. **CTSS ‚Äì Cluster Time Synchronization Service**

- **Function**: Synchronizes time across multiple devices in a network.
- **Standards**:
  - **IEEE 1588v2**: Precision Time Protocol ([[PTP]])
  - **IEEE 802.1AS-2020**: Generalized Precision Time Protocol ([[gPTP]])
- **Use Case**: Ensures all devices in a cluster operate on a unified time base, crucial for synchronized data acquisition and processing.

### 2. **PTSS ‚Äì Platform Time Synchronization Service**

- **Function**: Aligns internal clocks within a single device or measurement platform.
- **Mechanism**: Utilizes hardware-based synchronization methods to achieve high precision.
- **Use Case**: Maintains internal consistency, ensuring that all subsystems within a device are time-aligned.
