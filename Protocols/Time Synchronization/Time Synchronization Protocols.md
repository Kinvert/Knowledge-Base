# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Synchronization Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Time synchronization protocols** ensure that clocks across devices in a network are synchronized to a common time reference. Accurate time synchronization is critical for distributed systems, industrial automation, financial transactions, telecommunications, and scientific applications.

These protocols vary in terms of precision, scalability, and complexity. Some are designed for general-purpose use, while others are optimized for high-precision applications like industrial automation or scientific experiments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of Time Synchronization Protocols

1. **Accuracy**:
   - Provide varying levels of precision, from milliseconds to nanoseconds.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Support synchronization across small networks or large distributed systems.

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Include mechanisms to handle network delays, jitter, and clock drift.

4. **Time Sources**:
