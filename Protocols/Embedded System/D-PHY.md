# D-PHY (MIPI D-PHY)

D-PHY is a physical layer specification defined by the MIPI Alliance. It provides a high-speed serial interface primarily used for connecting cameras and displays in embedded systems. While most commonly associated with [[CSI-2]] (Camera Serial Interface) and [[DSI]] (Display Serial Interface), it is a general-purpose PHY layer that can be used by other MIPI protocols.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

D-PHY defines the electrical and timing characteristics of the physical connection between SoCs and peripherals. It is designed to balance **low-power** operation with **high-speed** data transfer, which is essential in mobile, robotics, and embedded platforms where both performance and efficiency matter.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Lanes**: Composed of one clock lane and one or more data lanes.  
- **Low-Power (LP) Mode**: Used for control and signaling at low speeds with low energy usage.  
- **High-Speed (HS) Mode**: Enables gigabit-per-second data transfer for video and sensor data.  
- **Source-Synchronous Signaling**: The clock lane provides synchronization for data lanes.  
- **Scalability**: Multiple data lanes can be used in parallel to increase throughput.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. Devices connect via one differential clock lane and multiple differential data lanes.  
2. During **Low-Power Mode**, the link handles command and control.  
3. When streaming video/data, the PHY switches into **High-Speed Mode**.  
4. Clock lane synchronizes transitions on data lanes to ensure timing alignment.

## üìñ Summary

D-PHY is the foundational MIPI physical layer that underpins most modern camera and display interfaces. While most often encountered in CSI-2 and DSI contexts, its design is more general-purpose, balancing high throughput with energy efficiency. In robotics and embedded vision, D-PHY serves as a critical enabler for high-resolution, low-latency sensor integration.
