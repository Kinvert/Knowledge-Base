# üîß Embedded System Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Embedded system protocols** are communication protocols designed for resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. These protocols enable data exchange between components within an embedded system or between embedded devices and external systems.

Embedded protocols are optimized for low power consumption, minimal hardware requirements, and real-time performance, making them essential for IoT, industrial automation, and consumer electronics.
