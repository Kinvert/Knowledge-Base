# üõ£Ô∏è Routing Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Routing protocols** are used to determine the best path for data to travel across a network. They enable routers to exchange information about network topology and dynamically adapt to changes, ensuring efficient and reliable data delivery.

Routing protocols are essential for both small-scale networks (e.g., LANs) and large-scale networks (e.g., the internet). They are categorized into **interior gateway protocols (IGPs)** for routing within an autonomous system (AS) and **exterior gateway protocols (EGPs)** for routing between autonomous systems.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of Routing Protocols

1. **Dynamic Path Selection**:
   - Automatically determine the best path based on metrics like distance, bandwidth, or delay.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Support networks of varying sizes, from small LANs to global internet routing.

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Adapt to network changes, such as link failures or topology updates.

4. **Convergence**:
   - Ensure all routers in the network have consistent routing information.

5. **Interoperability**:
   - Standardized protocols enable communication between devices from different vendors.

## üì¶ Common Routing Protocols

### [[RIP]] (Routing Information Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Distance-vector protocol for small networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses hop count as the metric (maximum: 15 hops).
  - Periodic updates every 30 seconds.
  - Simple but slow convergence.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Small LANs.
  - Legacy systems.

---

### [[OSPF]] (Open Shortest Path First)
- **Purpose**: Link-state protocol for large and complex networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path.
  - Divides networks into areas for scalability.
  - Fast convergence and supports authentication.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Enterprise networks.
  - Campus networks.
  - Dynamic routing within an autonomous system.

---

### [[EIGRP]] (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Cisco proprietary hybrid protocol combining distance-vector and link-state features.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) for fast convergence.
  - Supports unequal-cost load balancing.
  - Easy to configure and scalable.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Cisco-based enterprise networks.
  - Dynamic routing in large networks.

---

### [[BGP]] (Border Gateway Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Path-vector protocol for routing between autonomous systems.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses path attributes to determine the best path.
  - Highly scalable and policy-driven.
  - Backbone of the internet.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Internet backbone routing.
  - Large-scale enterprise networks.
  - Multi-homed networks.

---

### [[IS-IS]] (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
- **Purpose**: Link-state protocol for large networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Similar to OSPF but operates at Layer 2.
  - Supports large-scale networks with hierarchical design.
  - Widely used by ISPs.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Service provider networks.
  - Large enterprise networks.

---

### [[IGRP]] (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Legacy Cisco proprietary distance-vector protocol.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses composite metrics (bandwidth, delay, reliability, load).
  - Replaced by EIGRP.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Legacy Cisco networks.

---

### [[Static Routing]]
- **Purpose**: Manually configured routes for small or simple networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - No dynamic updates or overhead.
  - Requires manual configuration and maintenance.
  - Best for predictable, fixed networks.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Small networks.
  - Backup routes.
  - Simple point-to-point connections.

---

### [[Dynamic Routing]]
- **Purpose**: Automatically updates routes based on network changes.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
  - Adapts to topology changes.
  - Reduces administrative overhead.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Large, complex networks.
  - Networks with frequent topology changes.

## ‚úÖ Pros and ‚ùå Cons of Routing Protocols

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically adjust to network changes.
- **Scalability**: Support networks of varying sizes and complexities.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize data delivery paths based on metrics.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Dynamic routing protocols can be difficult to configure and troubleshoot.
- **Overhead**: Protocols like OSPF and BGP consume bandwidth and processing power.
- **Convergence Time**: Some protocols (e.g., RIP) have slow convergence times.
