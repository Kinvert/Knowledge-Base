# üìÇ eCALREC: eCAL Recording Format

## üß≠ Overview

**eCALREC** is the recording format used by **eCAL (Enhanced Communication Abstraction Layer)**, a middleware framework designed for high-performance data exchange in distributed systems. The `.ecalrec` file acts as a metadata file that organizes and references multiple **HDF5** files, which store the actual recorded data streams. This structure allows for efficient storage, replay, and analysis of large-scale, time-synchronized data.

The `.ecalrec` file is essential for managing distributed recordings, as it provides a centralized way to describe and access the individual HDF5 files that contain the recorded data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

1. **Centralized Metadata**:
   - The `.ecalrec` file serves as an index for all HDF5 files in a recording session, storing metadata about the recording.

2. **Time-Synchronized Data**:
   - Ensures all recorded data streams are synchronized with precise timestamps.

3. **Distributed Recording**:
   - Supports recording data from multiple nodes in a distributed system.

4. **Efficient Storage**:
   - Uses HDF5 files for compact and high-performance data storage.

5. **Replay Capability**:
   - Enables replaying recorded data streams for debugging, analysis, and simulation.

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Works seamlessly on Windows and Linux systems.

## üì¶ How eCALREC Works

1. **Recording Process**:
   - During a recording session, eCAL captures data streams (e.g., sensor data, telemetry) and stores them in multiple HDF5 files.
   - The `.ecalrec` file is created to act as a central metadata file that references these HDF5 files.

2. **File Structure**:
   - **`.ecalrec` File**: Contains metadata about the recording session, such as timestamps, topic names, and references to the associated HDF5 files.
   - **HDF5 Files**: Store the actual data streams, such as video, LiDAR, or telemetry data, in a compact and efficient format.

3. **Replay and Analysis**:
   - The `.ecalrec` file is used to load and replay the recorded data streams in eCAL Player.
   - Developers can analyze the data or export it to other formats for further processing.

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

1. **Autonomous Vehicle Development**:
   - Recording sensor data (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, radar) during test drives.
   - Replaying data for debugging and improving perception algorithms.

2. **Robotics**:
   - Logging telemetry and sensor data for robot testing and validation.
   - Simulating real-world scenarios using recorded data.

3. **Industrial Automation**:
   - Capturing data from distributed systems for diagnostics and optimization.
   - Analyzing time-synchronized data from multiple machines.

4. **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**:
   - Storing large datasets for training and testing machine learning models.
   - Examples include object detection, path planning, and sensor fusion.
