# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Storage

## üß≠ Overview

**Cloud storage** is a model of data storage where digital data is stored in logical pools across distributed servers, typically managed by a third-party provider. It enables users to store, access, and manage data over the internet, offering scalability, reliability, and accessibility.

Cloud storage is a cornerstone of modern computing, powering applications like backups, content delivery, and big data analytics. It eliminates the need for on-premises storage infrastructure, reducing costs and complexity for businesses and individuals.
