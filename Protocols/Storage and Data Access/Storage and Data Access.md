# üíæ Storage and Data Access Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Storage and data access protocols** enable communication between devices and storage systems, facilitating the transfer, retrieval, and management of data. These protocols are essential for local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), storage area networks (SANs), and cloud-based storage solutions.

Storage protocols are optimized for specific use cases, such as high-speed data transfer, scalability, or fault tolerance, and operate across various layers of the OSI model.
