# OpenWrt

**OpenWrt** is an open-source Linux distribution targeting embedded devices, particularly network routers. Unlike stock router firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management, enabling advanced customization, performance tuning, and integration with robotics or IoT systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

OpenWrt transforms consumer routers into flexible, Linux-based network appliances. It supports thousands of devices and allows engineers to add packages, configure services, and experiment with advanced networking setups. Its modular architecture makes it popular for robotics, IoT, and research environments that need reliable low-level networking.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Fully Writable Filesystem**: Unlike vendor firmware, it allows modification and package installation.
- **Package Management**: Uses `opkg` to install or remove software.
- **Kernel & Driver Support**: Broad support for network chipsets and embedded hardware.
- **Customizability**: Supports VPNs, firewalls, QoS, mesh networking, and more.
- **Community Driven**: Actively developed with long-term support for devices.
