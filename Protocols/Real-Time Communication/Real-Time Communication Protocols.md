# üïí Real-Time Communication Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Real-time communication (RTC) protocols** enable the exchange of audio, video, and data with minimal latency, making them essential for applications like video conferencing, online gaming, live streaming, and collaborative tools. These protocols are optimized for low-latency, high-reliability communication over networks.

RTC protocols operate across various layers of the OSI model, often combining transport, session, and application layer functionalities. They are designed to handle challenges like packet loss, jitter, and varying network conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of Real-Time Communication Protocols

1. **Low Latency**:
   - Ensure minimal delay for real-time interaction.

2. **Reliability**:
   - Include mechanisms for error correction and packet retransmission.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Support one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication.

4. **Interoperability**:
   - Standardized protocols ensure compatibility across devices and platforms.

5. **Security**:
   - Many protocols include encryption and authentication to protect data.

  - Video conferencing.
  - Live streaming.
  - VoIP (Voice over IP).

---

  - Contribution feeds for media production.
  - Secure video delivery.

---

### [[MPEG-DASH]] (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)
- **Purpose**: Adaptive streaming protocol for delivering video content.
- **Key Features**:
  - HTTP-based delivery.
  - Supports multiple codecs and resolutions.
  - Provides adaptive bitrate streaming.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Video-on-demand platforms.
  - Live streaming services.
  - Cross-platform video delivery.
