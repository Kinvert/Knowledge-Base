## ⚙️ CAPL Scripting Overview

**CAPL (Communication Access Programming Language)** is a C-like scripting language used in CANoe for creating custom test scenarios, automating tasks, and simulating complex network behaviors.

### Key Features:
- **Event-Driven**: Scripts respond to events like message reception, timer expiration, or user input.
- **Real-Time Execution**: CAPL scripts run in real time, making them ideal for HIL testing.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with CANoe's simulation and testing environment.

### Example CAPL Script:
```capl
on message CAN1.0x123
{
  write("Message received: %d", this.Data[0]);
  if (this.Data[0] > 100)
  {
    output(CAN1, 0x456, 1, {0x01}); // Send response message
  }
}
```
