# üõ†Ô∏è XCP (Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol)

## üß≠ Overview

**XCP (Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol)** is a protocol designed for real-time measurement, calibration, and diagnostics of electronic control units (ECUs). It is widely used in automotive and embedded systems to tune parameters, monitor performance, and debug software during development and testing.

XCP is transport-independent, meaning it can operate over various physical layers such as **CAN**, **Ethernet**, **FlexRay**, and **USB**. It is standardized under **ASAM (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems)**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How XCP Works

1. **Master-Slave Architecture**:
   - The **master** (e.g., a PC or test system) sends commands to the **slave** (e.g., an ECU).
   - The slave responds with data or executes the requested operation.

2. **Transport Independence**:
   - XCP is designed to work over multiple transport layers, including:
     - **CAN**: For low-speed, low-bandwidth applications.
     - **Ethernet**: For high-speed, high-bandwidth applications.
     - **FlexRay**: For deterministic, time-critical applications.
     - **USB**: For direct PC-to-ECU communication.

3. **Memory Access**:
   - XCP provides direct access to the ECU's memory for reading and writing parameters.
   - This allows real-time calibration and measurement without interrupting the ECU's normal operation.

4. **Event-Driven Communication**:
   - XCP supports event-based data acquisition, where the ECU sends data to the master based on predefined triggers.

## üß© Key Features

- **Real-Time Measurement**:
  - Enables high-speed data acquisition from the ECU for performance monitoring.

- **Calibration**:
  - Allows engineers to adjust parameters (e.g., fuel injection timing, throttle response) in real time.

- **Transport Independence**:
  - Operates over multiple physical layers, making it versatile for different applications.

- **Scalability**:
  - Supports a wide range of applications, from low-speed CAN to high-speed Ethernet.

- **Standardized**:
  - Defined by ASAM, ensuring interoperability across tools and systems.

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

- **Automotive Development**:
  - Tuning engine parameters, optimizing fuel efficiency, and calibrating ADAS systems.

- **Embedded Systems**:
  - Debugging and performance monitoring of microcontroller-based systems.

- **Electric Vehicles**:
  - Monitoring battery management systems (BMS) and calibrating motor controllers.

- **Diagnostics**:
  - Real-time fault detection and analysis during testing.
