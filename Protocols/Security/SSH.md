# 🔒 SSH (Secure Shell)

## 🧭 Overview

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication between devices over an unsecured network. It is widely used for remote login, command execution, and secure file transfers. SSH replaces older, insecure protocols like Telnet and rlogin by encrypting all communication.

SSH operates on **port 22** by default and provides a secure channel over an unsecured network using public-key cryptography.

## 🛠️ Key Features

1. **Secure Remote Access**:
   - Enables secure login to remote systems for administration and management.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Supports multiple authentication methods, including password-based and public-key authentication.

4. **Port Forwarding (Tunneling)**:
   - Allows secure forwarding of network traffic through the SSH connection.

5. **File Transfers**:
   - Supports secure file transfer protocols like **SCP** and **SFTP**.

6. **Extensibility**:
   - Can be used for advanced use cases like VPNs, SOCKS proxies, and automated scripts.

## 📦 Common Use Cases

1. **Remote Administration**:
   - Managing servers and devices remotely via a secure terminal.

2. **Secure File Transfers**:
   - Transferring files securely using SCP or SFTP.

3. **Tunneling**:
   - Forwarding ports securely for accessing internal systems or bypassing firewalls.

4. **Automation**:
   - Automating tasks using SSH in scripts or tools like Ansible.

5. **Development**:
   - Securely accessing remote development environments or deploying code.

## 🛠️ How to Use SSH

1. **Connecting to a Remote Server**:
   - Use an SSH client (e.g., [[OpenSSH]], [[PuTTY]]) to connect to a server:
     - `ssh username@hostname`

2. **Key-Based Authentication**:
   - Generate an SSH key pair:
     - Public key: Stored on the server.
     - Private key: Stored securely on the client.

3. **File Transfers**:
   - Use [[SCP]] or [[SFTP]] for secure file transfers:
     - `scp file.txt username@hostname:/path/to/destination`

4. **Port Forwarding**:
   - Forward a local port to a remote server:
     - `ssh -L local_port:remote_host:remote_port username@hostname`

5. **Tunneling**:
   - Use SSH as a [[SOCKS]] proxy:
     - `ssh -D local_port username@hostname`
