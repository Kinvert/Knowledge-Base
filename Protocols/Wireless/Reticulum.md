# Reticulum

Reticulum is a cryptographically secure networking stack designed for resilient, delay-tolerant, and peer-to-peer communication. It enables the creation of wide-area networks without reliance on centralized infrastructure, making it suitable for environments with unreliable connectivity, censorship concerns, or intermittent links. While not exclusive to robotics, Reticulum's self-healing mesh capabilities and support for heterogeneous transport mediums make it relevant for distributed robotic systems, remote sensing, and autonomous deployments.

## ⚙️ Overview

Reticulum provides a framework for encrypted, authenticated communication across a variety of transport layers. It abstracts the underlying medium — such as LoRa, TCP/IP, serial links, or even amateur radio — into a unified routing and addressing system. The stack is built around a delay-tolerant networking model, making it robust for long-range, low-bandwidth, or disrupted communications.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Addressing**: Uses cryptographic addresses derived from public keys to ensure identity and authenticity.
- **Routing**: Automatic multi-hop routing with no central coordination, leveraging mesh principles.
- **Transport Independence**: Works over diverse mediums like `LoRa`, `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `Bluetooth`, or `Serial`.
- **Delay Tolerance**: Can handle long delays between packet transmission and reception.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Default for all communications.
- **Resource Discovery**: Nodes can advertise available services without revealing unnecessary topology details.
