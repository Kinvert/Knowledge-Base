# üì° LTE-M (Long Term Evolution for Machines)

**LTE-M** (also known as Cat-M1) is a low-power wide-area (LPWA) cellular technology developed by 3GPP in Release 13, designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) applications requiring moderate data throughput, mobility, and extended battery life.

---

## üß† Summary

- Operates on licensed LTE bands.
- Fully supports cellular handover and voice (VoLTE).
- Higher throughput than [[NB-IoT]] with lower latency.
- Designed for both stationary and mobile IoT devices.

## üß™ Development Tips

- Verify your **SIM card supports LTE-M**, not all LTE SIMs do.
- Use **eDRX and PSM** to reduce power usage in sleep mode.
- Evaluate firmware/driver support for **modem AT commands**.
- Be aware of regional LTE bands (e.g., Band 12, 13, 20, etc).
- Consider tools like **[[CVAT]]** and **[[MQTT]]** for sensor data labeling and transmission.
