# BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication protocol designed for short-range, low-power data exchange. It‚Äôs optimized for applications where devices need to run for long periods on minimal power, such as IoT sensors, wearable devices, and robotics peripherals. BLE operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and is part of the Bluetooth 4.0+ specification, with continued enhancements in later versions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

BLE was developed to address the power limitations of classic Bluetooth, trading high throughput for energy efficiency. This makes it especially useful for battery-powered devices that require infrequent or small bursts of communication. Its ability to maintain connections with minimal power consumption makes it a key enabler for many mobile and embedded systems.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Advertising** ‚Äì Broadcasting small data packets to allow devices to be discovered.
- **GATT (Generic Attribute Profile)** ‚Äì Data exchange architecture in BLE for defining services and characteristics.
- **Services & Characteristics** ‚Äì BLE data is organized into services (collections) containing characteristics (data points).
- **Connection Parameters** ‚Äì Control latency, interval, and timeout to balance power and responsiveness.
- **Roles** ‚Äì Central (initiates connection), Peripheral (advertises data), Broadcaster, Observer.
