# üì° NB-IoT (Narrowband Internet of Things)

**NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)** is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) radio technology standardized by 3GPP (Release 13) to enable efficient communication for devices that transmit small amounts of data over long periods and long ranges.

---

## üß† Summary

- LPWAN technology using existing LTE infrastructure.
- Designed for applications needing low data throughput, deep coverage, and long battery life.
- Operates on licensed spectrum (unlike LoRa or Sigfox).
- Often bundled with LTE-M in modern modules.

## üß™ Development Tips

- Check SIM card and carrier support for NB-IoT bands.
- Use modules with onboard TCP/IP stack for simpler MCU integration.
- Evaluate power consumption carefully using PSM and eDRX modes.
- Avoid mobile use cases‚ÄîNB-IoT excels at stationary deployments.
- Consider pairing with MQTT or CoAP for data transmission.
