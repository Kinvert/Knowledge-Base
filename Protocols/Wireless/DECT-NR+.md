# DECT-NR+ (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications ‚Äì New Radio Plus)

DECT-NR+ is a wireless communication standard designed for industrial, IoT, and robotics applications, extending the original DECT standard to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). It operates in a dedicated, license-free frequency band and is standardized by ETSI. DECT-NR+ is optimized for private networks, enabling secure, scalable, and interference-resilient connectivity for autonomous systems, industrial control, and sensor networks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

DECT-NR+ modernizes DECT by incorporating 5G NR principles, delivering deterministic performance without depending on public cellular infrastructure. It supports mesh topologies, high node density, and predictable latency, making it suitable for robotics fleets, smart factories, and safety-critical automation.
