# BLE Mesh (Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Networking)

BLE Mesh is an extension of the Bluetooth Low Energy standard that enables many-to-many (m:m) device communication over a mesh topology. It allows BLE devices to relay messages through intermediate nodes, vastly extending coverage and enabling robust, large-scale networks without requiring high power consumption.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Introduced by the Bluetooth SIG in 2017, BLE Mesh was designed for large networks such as industrial automation, smart buildings, and sensor arrays. Unlike point-to-point or star topologies in standard BLE, mesh networking uses a flooding-based message relay system where nodes forward messages to others, ensuring data reaches all relevant devices.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Nodes** ‚Äì Devices participating in the mesh.
- **Relay Nodes** ‚Äì Forward messages to extend network coverage.
- **Friend Nodes & Low Power Nodes (LPN)** ‚Äì Friend nodes store messages for battery-powered LPNs to retrieve later.
- **Publish/Subscribe Model** ‚Äì Devices publish messages to specific addresses and subscribe to messages of interest.
- **Managed Flooding** ‚Äì Messages propagate via multiple hops without complex routing tables.
- **Provisioning** ‚Äì Secure process of adding devices to a mesh network.
