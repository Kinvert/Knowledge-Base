# IEEE 802.15.4

IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) standard that defines the physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers for low-power, short-range communications. It serves as the foundation for higher-level protocols like [[Zigbee]], [[Thread]], and [[6LoWPAN]].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

First ratified in 2003 by the IEEE, 802.15.4 targets embedded and IoT applications that require low data rates, low power consumption, and robust operation in noisy environments. It operates in multiple unlicensed frequency bands and supports star, peer-to-peer, and mesh topologies through higher-layer protocols.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **PHY Layer** ‚Äì Defines modulation, data rates, and frequency bands.
- **MAC Layer** ‚Äì Handles frame formatting, addressing, channel access (CSMA/CA), and acknowledgments.
- **Frequency Bands** ‚Äì 868 MHz (EU), 915 MHz (US), 2.4 GHz (global).
- **Data Rates** ‚Äì From 20 kbps (868 MHz) to 250 kbps (2.4 GHz).
- **Device Types**:
  - **Full-Function Device (FFD)** ‚Äì Can serve as coordinator or router.
  - **Reduced-Function Device (RFD)** ‚Äì Simple, end-node devices.
- **Addressing** ‚Äì 16-bit short addresses or 64-bit extended IEEE addresses.
