# ExpressLRS

**ExpressLRS (ELRS)** is an open-source, high-performance, and low-latency radio control link for RC applications such as drones, planes, and robotics. It has rapidly become a popular alternative to proprietary systems due to its low cost, strong community support, and high update rates. ELRS builds on LoRa (Long Range) modulation to achieve both long range and high reliability while maintaining impressive responsiveness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

ExpressLRS was designed to replace traditional RC protocols by delivering:
- Lower latency than most commercial systems
- Higher update rates (up to 1000 Hz)
- Longer range and stronger link reliability
- Affordable hardware with open-source firmware

It is widely used in FPV drone racing, long-range RC flying, and increasingly in robotics where fast and deterministic wireless control is important.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **LoRa modulation**: Provides long range and robust communication
- **Packet rates**: 25 Hz to 1000 Hz, allowing trade-offs between range and latency
- **Frequency bands**: 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz commonly used
- **Telemetry**: Bidirectional link supports telemetry data (voltage, GPS, sensor data)
- **Open source**: Community-driven development, no vendor lock-in
- **Cross-compatibility**: Works with a variety of hardware manufacturers
