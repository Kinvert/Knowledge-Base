# üì° Wireless Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Wireless protocols** enable communication between devices without physical connections, using radio waves, infrared, or other wireless technologies. These protocols are essential for modern networking, IoT (Internet of Things), and smart devices, providing flexibility, scalability, and mobility.

Wireless protocols operate across various layers of the OSI model, often combining physical, data link, and network layer functionalities. They are optimized for specific use cases, such as low-power IoT devices, high-speed data transfer, or long-range communication.
