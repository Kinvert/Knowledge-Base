# MeshCore

MeshCore is an open-source C++ mesh networking stack and firmware for embedded systems using LoRa and other packet radio transports. It enables secure, decentralized, off-grid communication using multi-hop routing‚Äîideal for rugged, infrastructure-limited, or emergency environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

MeshCore provides a lightweight, modular alternative to Meshtastic, focusing on flexibility, low resource usage, and multi-transport support. It works without central servers or internet connectivity and is built for developers who need more control over network behavior.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Multi-hop packet routing** ‚Äì Messages are relayed across multiple nodes to extend range.
- **Flooding with deduplication & TTL** ‚Äì Prevents message loops and controls network load.
- **Transport-agnostic design** ‚Äì Works with LoRa, BLE, Wi-Fi, serial, and UDP.
- **End-to-end encryption** ‚Äì Supports AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- **Node roles** ‚Äì Relay, endpoint, or hybrid operation modes.
- **Provisioning & discovery** ‚Äì Secure onboarding and network mapping via Hello messages.
