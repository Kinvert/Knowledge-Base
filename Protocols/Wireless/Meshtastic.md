# Meshtastic

Meshtastic is an open-source, long-range mesh communication platform based on [[LoRa]] radios. It enables text and GPS messaging without reliance on cellular, Wi-Fi, or internet infrastructure. Nodes automatically form a mesh network to extend coverage in off-grid, emergency, or remote environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Originating as a community-driven project, Meshtastic is designed for resilience and portability. Devices‚Äîoften small ESP32-based LoRa boards‚Äîconnect to phones or computers via Bluetooth or USB, allowing users to send encrypted messages over a mesh network. The system is optimized for long battery life and field use, with global adoption among outdoor enthusiasts, emergency responders, and IoT experimenters.
