# Mesh Federation

Mesh Federation is a networking concept where multiple independent mesh networks interconnect and cooperate, forming a larger unified communication framework. In robotics and IoT, this enables devices across different mesh domains to communicate seamlessly without requiring a single centralized authority.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Mesh Federation extends the principles of mesh networking by allowing **inter-mesh communication**, creating a **federated topology**. Unlike a single mesh, where all devices are in the same domain, federation connects multiple autonomous meshes together.

This approach is valuable in **large-scale robotics**, **industrial automation**, and **IoT deployments** where devices may need to interact across organizational or physical boundaries.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Mesh Network**: A decentralized communication structure where nodes relay data for one another.
- **Federation Layer**: Middleware or protocol enabling interoperability between independent meshes.
- **Autonomy & Trust**: Each mesh may maintain independent control, policies, and security domains.
- **Scalability**: Federation prevents performance bottlenecks that arise from very large single meshes.
