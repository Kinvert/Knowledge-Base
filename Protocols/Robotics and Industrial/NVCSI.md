# NVCSI (NVIDIA Camera Serial Interface)

**NVCSI (NVIDIA Camera Serial Interface)** is NVIDIA’s implementation of the CSI-2 (Camera Serial Interface 2) standard, used to connect image sensors directly to NVIDIA SoCs such as the Jetson family. It enables high-bandwidth, low-latency transfer of raw image data into the GPU/ISP (Image Signal Processor) pipeline, which is critical for robotics, computer vision, and AI applications.

## ⚙️ Overview

NVCSI serves as the hardware and protocol layer for receiving image data from cameras over the MIPI CSI-2 standard. It is tightly integrated with NVIDIA’s Image Signal Processor (ISP), Argus API, and V4L2 drivers. NVCSI provides flexible lane configurations, supporting multiple cameras with synchronized capture through features like [[FSIN]] and [[FSOUT]].

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **CSI-2 Standard**: Industry protocol for high-speed image data transfer.  
- **MIPI Lanes**: NVCSI supports 1, 2, 4, or 6-lane configurations depending on Jetson model.  
- **Virtual Channels (VCs)**: Allow multiple camera streams over shared physical lanes.  
- **Integration with ISP**: NVCSI feeds raw data directly into the ISP for preprocessing.  
- **Synchronization**: Works with hardware triggers (FSIN/FSOUT) for multi-camera setups.  
- **Driver Support**: Managed via NVIDIA’s V4L2 and LibArgus frameworks.
