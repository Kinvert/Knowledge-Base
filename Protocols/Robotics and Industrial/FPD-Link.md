# FPD-Link (Flat Panel Display Link)

**FPD-Link (Flat Panel Display Link)** is a high-speed digital video interface developed by Texas Instruments. Originally designed for connecting graphics processors to flat-panel displays, FPD-Link has evolved into a key serializer-deserializer (SerDes) technology used in automotive, robotics, and industrial systems. It enables long-distance, high-bandwidth transmission of video, control, and data signals over a single cable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

FPD-Link transmits serialized video and data over differential pairs, with deserializers reconstructing the original signals at the receiving end. Newer generations, such as **FPD-Link II** and **FPD-Link III**, add features like bidirectional control channels, embedded clocking, and power-over-coax. In robotics and autonomous systems, FPD-Link is widely used to connect cameras and displays to central processors across several meters.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **SerDes Technology**: Converts parallel data into serial streams for transmission, then back again.  
- **Differential Signaling**: Uses LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) for noise immunity.  
- **Embedded Clocking**: Later generations removed the need for a separate clock line.  
- **Long Cable Support**: Enables reliable data transmission over coaxial or shielded twisted pair.  
- **Power-over-Coax (PoC)**: Supplies power and data through a single cable.  
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple video streams in advanced automotive/robotic systems.
