# DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)

DePIN refers to blockchain-based, community-owned networks that incentivize users to contribute physical infrastructure such as connectivity, compute, storage, or location services. In the context of [[RTK]] and [[GPS]], DePIN models are being explored to provide decentralized, high-precision positioning infrastructure, reducing reliance on centralized providers.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

DePIN enables individuals and organizations to collectively deploy and maintain infrastructure. Instead of a single centralized provider offering RTK correction data or GPS augmentation services, a distributed network of contributors can share, validate, and monetize their resources.

For robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial applications, this approach can democratize access to centimeter-level accuracy.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Decentralization**: Community-driven network ownership, reducing monopoly risks.
- **Token Incentives**: Participants earn tokens for contributing base stations, bandwidth, or data.
- **Trustless Verification**: Blockchain ensures reliability and auditability of correction streams.
- **Coverage Expansion**: Global scalability through crowdsourced deployment of RTK/GPS augmentation nodes.
