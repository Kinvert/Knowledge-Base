# GMSL2

**GMSL2 (Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link, Generation 2)** is a high-speed SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) interface developed by Maxim Integrated (now Analog Devices). It is widely used in automotive and robotics applications for transmitting uncompressed video, audio, control data, and power over a single coaxial cable or shielded twisted pair (STP). Its low latency and long-distance capabilities make it an enabling technology for advanced vision-based systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

GMSL2 enables robust, high-bandwidth data transmission between sensors (such as cameras) and central processing units (such as ECUs or robotics computers). It supports resolutions up to 4K, multiple data streams, and power delivery over the same physical link. This reduces cabling complexity while ensuring reliable data integrity in noisy environments.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Serializer/Deserializer**: A serializer converts parallel data (e.g., from a camera) into a serialized high-speed stream, while the deserializer restores it to parallel form for processing.  
- **Medium**: Operates over coaxial cables (up to ~15 m) or STP (up to ~10 m).  
- **Multiplexing**: Can carry video, audio, I¬≤C/GPIO control signals, and power simultaneously.  
- **Power over Coax (POC)**: Eliminates separate power cabling for sensors.  
- **Low Latency**: <10 ¬µs, making it suitable for real-time robotics and ADAS.
