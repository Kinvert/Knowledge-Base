# üì° RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)

## üß≠ Overview

**RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)** is a high-precision satellite navigation technique that enhances the accuracy of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning to centimeter-level by using real-time correction data from a reference station. RTK is widely used in surveying, precision agriculture, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and any application where sub-meter or centimeter-level positioning is required.

RTK works by transmitting correction data from a fixed base station (with a known position) to one or more mobile receivers (rovers), allowing them to correct for errors in satellite signals such as atmospheric delays and satellite clock drift.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Centimeter-Level Accuracy**: Achieves 1‚Äì2 cm horizontal accuracy under ideal conditions.
- **Real-Time Corrections**: Provides instant position updates with corrections applied.
- **Multi-Constellation Support**: Works with GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, and other GNSS systems.
- **Base and Rover Architecture**: Requires a fixed base station and one or more rovers.
- **Low Latency**: Suitable for real-time applications like autonomous navigation and machine control.
- **Correction Data Formats**: Commonly uses RTCM (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services) or proprietary protocols.

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

- **Land Surveying**: High-precision mapping and boundary determination.
- **Precision Agriculture**: Automated tractor guidance, planting, and spraying.
- **Construction**: Machine control, site layout, and grading.
- **Robotics and Drones**: Accurate localization for autonomous navigation.
- **Marine Navigation**: Harbor operations, dredging, and hydrographic surveys.
- **Asset Tracking**: High-accuracy tracking of vehicles and equipment.

## üõ†Ô∏è How RTK Works

1. **Base Station Setup**:  
   - A GNSS receiver is placed at a known, fixed location (the base station).
2. **Correction Data Generation**:  
   - The base station calculates the difference between its known position and the position calculated from satellite signals.
3. **Correction Data Transmission**:  
   - The base station transmits correction data to rovers via radio, cellular, or internet (NTRIP).
4. **Rover Positioning**:  
   - The rover receives both satellite signals and correction data, applying the corrections to achieve high-precision positioning.
