# üõ∞Ô∏è GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)

## üß≠ Overview

**GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)** is a general term for satellite-based systems that provide global positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. GNSS encompasses all satellite constellations that enable users with compatible receivers to determine their location, velocity, and time anywhere on Earth.

Major GNSS constellations include:
- **GPS** (United States)
- **GLONASS** (Russia)
- **Galileo** (European Union)
- **BeiDou** (China)
- **QZSS** (Japan, regional)
- **NavIC** (India, regional)

Modern GNSS receivers often use multiple constellations simultaneously for improved accuracy, reliability, and availability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Global Coverage**: Provides positioning and timing data worldwide.
- **Multi-Constellation Support**: Receivers can use signals from several GNSS systems for better accuracy and redundancy.
- **High Precision**: Standard accuracy is typically 5‚Äì10 meters; advanced techniques (e.g., D-GPS, RTK) can achieve centimeter-level precision.
- **Time Synchronization**: Supplies precise timing for telecommunications, power grids, and financial systems.
- **Passive Reception**: Receivers only listen to satellite signals, ensuring privacy and low power consumption.

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

- **Navigation**: Automotive, aviation, maritime, and pedestrian navigation.
- **Surveying and Mapping**: Land surveying, construction, and geospatial data collection.
- **Timing and Synchronization**: Telecommunications, data centers, and financial transactions.
- **Asset Tracking**: Logistics, fleet management, and personal trackers.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Drones, robots, and self-driving vehicles.
- **Precision Agriculture**: Automated guidance, planting, and harvesting.
