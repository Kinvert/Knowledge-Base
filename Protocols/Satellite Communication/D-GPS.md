# üõ∞Ô∏è D-GPS (Differential GPS)

## üß≠ Overview

**D-GPS (Differential GPS)** is an enhanced version of the Global Positioning System (GPS) that provides significantly higher accuracy by using additional reference stations and sensors. It corrects GPS signals in real-time by accounting for errors caused by atmospheric conditions, satellite clock drift, and signal multipath effects.

D-GPS is widely used in applications requiring precise positioning, such as surveying, autonomous vehicles, agriculture, and maritime navigation.
