# üõ∞Ô∏è GPS (Global Positioning System)

## üß≠ Overview

**GPS (Global Positioning System)** is a satellite-based navigation system that provides location, velocity, and time synchronization data to devices on Earth. It is operated by the **United States Department of Defense** and is freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver. GPS is one of the most widely used positioning systems, enabling applications in navigation, mapping, and time synchronization.

GPS operates using a constellation of at least **24 satellites** orbiting the Earth, which transmit signals to receivers. By calculating the time it takes for signals to travel from multiple satellites, a GPS receiver can determine its precise location.

## üõ†Ô∏è How GPS Works

1. **Satellite Constellation**:
   - GPS uses a network of at least 24 satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO), ensuring global coverage.

2. **Triangulation**:
   - A GPS receiver calculates its position by measuring the time it takes for signals to travel from at least four satellites.

3. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Each satellite has an atomic clock, ensuring precise timing for accurate positioning.

4. **Error Sources**:
   - GPS accuracy can be affected by atmospheric conditions, signal multipath, and satellite clock drift.
