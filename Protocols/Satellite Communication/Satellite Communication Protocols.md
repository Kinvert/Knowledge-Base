# üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Communication Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Satellite communication protocols** enable the transmission of data, voice, and video between ground stations, satellites, and other devices in space. These protocols are designed to handle the unique challenges of satellite communication, such as long distances, high latency, and limited bandwidth.

Satellite communication protocols are essential for applications like global internet coverage, remote sensing, navigation, broadcasting, and space exploration. They operate across various layers of the OSI model, from physical transmission to application-level data exchange.
