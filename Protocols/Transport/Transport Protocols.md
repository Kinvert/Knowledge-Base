# üöö Transport Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Transport protocols** operate at the **transport layer (Layer 4)** of the OSI model. They are responsible for end-to-end communication between devices, ensuring data is reliably delivered (or not, depending on the protocol) across a network. Transport protocols manage tasks like error detection, flow control, and session multiplexing.

The two most widely used transport protocols are **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**, but other protocols exist for specialized use cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of Transport Protocols

1. **End-to-End Communication**:
   - Provide a direct communication channel between applications on different devices.

2. **Reliability**:
   - Some protocols (e.g., TCP) ensure reliable delivery of data, while others (e.g., UDP) prioritize speed over reliability.

3. **Multiplexing**:
   - Allow multiple applications to share the same network connection using ports.

4. **Error Detection and Correction**:
   - Include mechanisms to detect and correct errors in transmitted data.

5. **Flow Control**:
   - Manage the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiver.

## üì¶ Common Transport Protocols

### [[TCP]] (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- **Key Features**:
  - Ensures data is delivered in order and without errors.
  - Uses a three-way handshake to establish connections.
  - Implements flow control and congestion control.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - File transfers (FTP).
  - Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3).

---

### [[UDP]] (User Datagram Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Fast, connectionless communication.
- **Key Features**:
  - No guarantee of delivery, order, or error correction.
  - Lightweight and low-latency.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Video streaming.
  - Online gaming.
  - DNS queries.

---

### [[QUIC]] (Quick UDP Internet Connections)
- **Purpose**: Modern transport protocol designed to improve the performance of HTTP/3.
- **Key Features**:
  - Built on UDP but adds reliability, encryption, and multiplexing.
  - Reduces connection setup latency compared to TCP.
- **Use Cases**:
  - HTTP/3 communication.
  - Real-time applications requiring low latency.

---

### [[SCTP]] (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Reliable, message-oriented communication.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports multi-streaming (multiple independent streams within a single connection).
  - Provides multi-homing (multiple IP addresses for redundancy).
  - Combines features of TCP and UDP.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Telephony signaling (e.g., SS7 over IP).
  - Real-time applications requiring reliability and low latency.

---

### [[DCCP]] (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Connection-oriented protocol for unreliable data delivery.
- **Key Features**:
  - Adds congestion control to UDP-like communication.
  - Suitable for applications that can tolerate some data loss but need congestion management.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Streaming media.
  - VoIP (Voice over IP).

---

### [[RTP]] (Real-Time Transport Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Protocol for delivering real-time data, such as audio and video.
- **Key Features**:
  - Works with UDP for low-latency communication.
  - Includes timestamps and sequence numbers for synchronization.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Video conferencing.
  - Live streaming.
  - Online gaming.

---

### [[SPX]] (Sequenced Packet Exchange)
- **Purpose**: Legacy protocol for reliable communication.
- **Key Features**:
  - Connection-oriented, similar to TCP.
  - Used in older Novell NetWare systems.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Legacy systems and applications.

## ‚úÖ Pros and ‚ùå Cons of Transport Protocols

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Reliability**: Protocols like TCP ensure data integrity and delivery.
- **Flexibility**: Different protocols are optimized for different use cases (e.g., UDP for speed, TCP for reliability).
- **Scalability**: Transport protocols enable efficient communication across large networks.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Overhead**: Reliable protocols like TCP introduce additional latency and resource usage.
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple transport protocols in a system can increase complexity.
- **Specialization**: Some protocols (e.g., SCTP, DCCP) are not widely supported, limiting their adoption.
