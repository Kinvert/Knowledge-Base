# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Server-Sent Events (SSE)** is a communication protocol that allows a server to push real-time updates to the browser over a single HTTP connection. Unlike WebSockets, SSE is **unidirectional**, meaning messages flow from server to client only.

---

## üîç Overview

- Built on **HTTP** (specifically `text/event-stream` content type)
- Maintains a **persistent connection** to push updates to the client
- Often used for real-time notifications, logs, or feeds
- Supported natively in most modern browsers via the `EventSource` API

---

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Uses standard HTTP ‚Äî easy to integrate with existing infrastructure
- Efficient for **one-way** data updates (e.g., stock tickers, chat updates)
- Auto-reconnects and can include **last event ID** for resuming after disconnect
- **Text-based** and very lightweight compared to full-duplex options

| Protocol      | Direction      | Built On  | Complexity | Ideal Use |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| SSE           | Server ‚Üí Client | HTTP      | Simple     | Notifications, feeds |
| WebSockets    | Bi-directional | TCP       | Medium     | Chat, gaming, live apps |
| Long Polling  | Server ‚Üí Client | HTTP      | Higher     | Legacy support, fallback |
