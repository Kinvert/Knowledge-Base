# üéµ M3U8: HTTP Live Streaming Playlist Format

## üß≠ Overview

**M3U8** is a playlist file format used in **HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)**, a protocol developed by Apple for delivering audio and video content over the internet. M3U8 files are UTF-8 encoded versions of the older **M3U** format and are widely used for adaptive bitrate streaming.

An M3U8 file contains a list of media segment URLs or other playlists, enabling clients to dynamically adjust the quality of the stream based on network conditions and device capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

1. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**:
   - Supports multiple quality levels for seamless playback across varying network conditions.
   - Clients can switch between streams dynamically.

2. **Segmented Media**:
   - References small chunks of media files (e.g., `.ts` files) for efficient delivery and buffering.

3. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Compatible with most modern devices and media players.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Supports metadata, encryption, and DRM (Digital Rights Management).

5. **Text-Based Format**:
   - Easy to read and edit with any text editor.

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

1. **Video Streaming**:
   - Live streaming platforms (e.g., Twitch, YouTube Live).
   - Video-on-demand services (e.g., Netflix, Hulu).

2. **Audio Streaming**:
   - Internet radio and music streaming services.

3. **Adaptive Streaming**:
   - Delivering content to devices with varying screen resolutions and bandwidth.

4. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**:
   - Efficiently distributing media content across geographically dispersed servers.
