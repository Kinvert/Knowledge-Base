# üîå MIPI CSI-2 Protocol

**MIPI CSI-2 (Mobile Industry Processor Interface ‚Äì Camera Serial Interface 2)** is a high-speed, point-to-point serial interface standard designed to connect cameras to host processors, such as SoCs used in mobile phones, embedded systems, and single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.

---

## üß† Summary

- CSI-2 is a widely adopted interface for camera modules.
- Designed by the **MIPI Alliance** for **low power, high bandwidth** communication.
- Commonly used in smartphones, embedded vision systems, and robotics.
- It transmits **uncompressed image data** from camera sensors to processors using **differential signaling**.
- Works in conjunction with the **MIPI D-PHY** or **C-PHY** physical layers.

## üîß Architecture Overview

| Component     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Camera Sensor** | Source of raw image data                                                 |
| **Serializer**    | Converts image data to CSI-2 packet format                              |
| **PHY Layer**     | Electrical interface (D-PHY or C-PHY) using differential pairs          |
| **Receiver (Host)** | SoC or processor that receives and processes CSI-2 data               |
| **Control Interface** | I¬≤C interface for control and configuration of the camera           |

## üîå Physical Layer (D-PHY)

MIPI CSI-2 is usually implemented over **MIPI D-PHY**, a low-power differential signaling interface.

- **Clock Lane (CP/CN)**: One pair of differential wires
- **Data Lanes (DPx/DNx)**: One or more differential pairs
  - Typically 1‚Äì4 lanes
  - Each lane can operate up to 2.5 Gbps (some newer specs go even higher)

---

## üì¶ Data Transmission

- Uses **packet-based transmission**:
  - Short packets: metadata (e.g. frame start, end)
  - Long packets: image data (e.g. RAW10, YUV422, RGB888)
- Data is **serialized** and transmitted in frames.
- **Lane Skew Calibration** ensures that bits from different lanes align properly.

| Layer           | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application Layer** | Camera sensor, generating raw image data                         |
| **CSI-2 Protocol Layer** | Converts image lines into packets                             |
| **PHY Protocol Interface (PPI)** | Bridges CSI-2 layer and PHY layer                      |
| **D-PHY Layer**         | Physical transmission of bits over differential pairs           |

## üß™ Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                      | Possible Causes                                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Camera not detected        | Loose ribbon cable, improper CSI port usage                    |
| `start_x` not enabled      | On Raspberry Pi, `start_x=1` must be set in `config.txt`       |
| Blank image                | I2C misconfiguration or unsupported resolution                 |
| Kernel errors              | Driver issues, bad firmware, or incompatible module            |
| Frame drops                | Insufficient bandwidth or thermal throttling                   |
