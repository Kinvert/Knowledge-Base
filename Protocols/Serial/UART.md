# UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)

## üìù Summary

**UART** is a **hardware communication protocol** used to send and receive serial data asynchronously between two digital devices. It is one of the simplest and most widely used serial interfaces in embedded systems.

UART does **not require a shared clock** between sender and receiver. Instead, it uses agreed-upon baud rates and start/stop bits to synchronize data transmission.

## üìö OSI Model Placement

| Layer   | Name         | UART's Role                         |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Layer 1 | Physical     | Defines voltage levels, connections |
| Layer 2 | Data Link    | Handles start/stop bits, parity     |

UART spans both the **Physical** and **Data Link** layers. It's a foundational protocol used at the hardware level for device-to-device communication.

## üß∞ Components of UART Communication

- **TX (Transmit)** and **RX (Receive)** lines
- **Baud rate**: Common values include 9600, 115200, etc.
- **Start bit**: Indicates beginning of a data frame
- **Data bits**: Usually 7 or 8
- **Optional parity bit**
- **Stop bit(s)**: Marks end of frame

## üîÑ How UART Works

1. Sender converts parallel data into serial bits and transmits via TX.
2. Receiver listens on RX and reconstructs the parallel byte.
3. Both sides must use **identical settings** (baud rate, parity, stop bits).
4. **No clock line** is shared, so timing must match closely.

## üì¶ Use Cases

| Use Case                          | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Debugging embedded systems       | UART ports often provide serial console access  |
| Microcontroller communication    | Simple MCU-to-MCU or MCU-to-PC links            |
| GPS and sensor modules           | Many use UART for data output                   |
| Serial terminals                 | Legacy command interfaces (e.g., RS-232 over UART) |

## üîß Hardware & Standards

| Spec / Standard     | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| RS-232              | Commonly implemented over UART (voltage levels differ) |
| TTL-Level UART      | Used in MCUs like Arduino, STM32, ESP32     |
| RS-485              | Differential signaling, often uses UART framing |
| IEEE 1284           | Not directly UART, but relevant to serial interfacing |
