# CRSF (Crossfire Serial Protocol)

Crossfire Serial Protocol (CRSF) is a high-performance, low-latency digital communication protocol primarily used in radio control (RC) systems. It was introduced by Team BlackSheep (TBS) for long-range RC applications and has since become a standard for reliable communication between transmitters, receivers, and other hardware in robotics, drones, and UAVs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

CRSF is designed to be faster and more efficient than traditional RC protocols such as SBUS or PPM. It uses a bidirectional serial link with high update rates, making it suitable for latency-sensitive applications like drone racing, autonomous robotics, and industrial systems requiring precise control.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Bidirectional Communication**: Allows not only control signals to be sent but also telemetry data to be received.
- **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond latency in optimized setups.
- **Compact Frames**: Efficient binary protocol with minimal overhead.
- **Standardized Extensions**: Supports telemetry, sensor data, and configuration commands.
