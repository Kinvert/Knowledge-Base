# üß∞ JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)

JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is both the name of a standard and the general name used to refer to the boundary-scan architecture used primarily for testing printed circuit boards (PCBs) and debugging integrated circuits (ICs). It has become a widely adopted standard for embedded system debugging, device programming, and hardware verification.

## üîé Summary

- **Full Name**: Joint Test Action Group (IEEE 1149.1 Standard)
- **Type**: Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture
- **Use Cases**: Testing, debugging, device programming, in-system programming, fault isolation
- **First Published**: 1990 (IEEE 1149.1)

## üß¨ How JTAG Works

JTAG uses a special set of dedicated pins and serial protocol to allow external tools to interact directly with the internals of integrated circuits or entire boards.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| TDI (Test Data In) | Serial data input |
| TDO (Test Data Out) | Serial data output |
| TCK (Test Clock) | Clock signal |
| TMS (Test Mode Select) | Mode control |
| TRST (optional) | Test Reset |

The devices connected via JTAG form a daisy chain (scan chain). The controller shifts test instructions and data through the chain, allowing inspection or manipulation of each device's internal state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Boundary Scan Testing | Detects manufacturing defects on PCBs like solder bridges or opens |
| Debugging | Low-level debugging of embedded processors and microcontrollers |
| Firmware Programming | Flashing microcontrollers, FPGAs, CPLDs, and other ICs |
| Hardware Verification | Internal state visibility for validating hardware behavior |
| Security Analysis | Used in reverse engineering or security vulnerability assessments |
