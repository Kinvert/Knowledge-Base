# üì° Serial Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Serial protocols** are communication protocols that transmit data sequentially, one bit at a time, over a communication channel. They are widely used in embedded systems, industrial automation, and device-to-device communication due to their simplicity, low cost, and reliability.

Serial protocols operate at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model and are optimized for short-distance communication. They vary in terms of speed, complexity, and use cases, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of Serial Protocols

1. **Point-to-Point or Multi-Device Communication**:
   - Support direct communication between two devices or multiple devices on a shared bus.

2. **Low Cost**:
   - Require minimal hardware, making them ideal for embedded systems.

3. **Simplicity**:
   - Easy to implement and widely supported by microcontrollers and devices.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Some protocols (e.g., RS-485, CAN) support long distances and multiple devices.

5. **Error Detection**:
   - Many protocols include basic error detection mechanisms, such as parity bits or checksums.
