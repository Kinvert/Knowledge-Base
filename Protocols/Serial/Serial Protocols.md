## ðŸ“¡ Serial Protocols Comparison

This document summarizes and compares commonly used serial communication protocols. These are often used for microcontroller-to-device or device-to-device communication across short distances, with tradeoffs in speed, complexity, and use case.

### ðŸ§  Notes

- **UART** is a hardware block; protocols like RS-232 or RS-485 build on top of it.
    
- **IÂ²C** and **SPI** are common in embedded systems; IÂ²C allows multi-master, SPI is much faster.
    
- **CAN** is fault-tolerant and designed for noise-heavy environments (like cars).
    
- **RS-485** allows for longer distances than RS-232 and is often used with Modbus.
    
- **1-Wire** can deliver both data and power, but it's slow.
    
- **LIN** is used in automotive contexts where CAN is overkill.
    
- **Modbus** is a higher-level protocol and can be layered on RS-485 or TCP/IP.
