# HaLow (Wi-Fi HaLow / IEEE 802.11ah)

**Wi-Fi HaLow** (IEEE 802.11ah) is a low-power, long-range extension of Wi-Fi designed for IoT, robotics, and industrial applications. Operating in the sub-1 GHz spectrum, HaLow supports energy-efficient communication with better penetration through obstacles compared to traditional Wi-Fi bands (2.4/5 GHz).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

HaLow extends Wi-Fi into the sub-GHz ISM bands (typically 750‚Äì950 MHz), enabling kilometer-scale coverage while maintaining compatibility with IP-based networking. It is ideal for IoT sensors, robotics fleets, and low-bandwidth control systems. Compared to Bluetooth or Zigbee, HaLow supports larger networks and higher throughput.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Sub-1 GHz Band**: Longer range, better wall penetration.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for battery-powered devices.
- **IoT Scalability**: Supports thousands of devices per access point.
- **Wi-Fi Compatibility**: Uses standard IP networking, unlike some IoT-specific protocols.
- **OFDM & Narrow Channels**: Flexible channel widths (1‚Äì16 MHz) for range/throughput trade-offs.
