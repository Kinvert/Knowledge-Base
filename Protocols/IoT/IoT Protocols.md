# üåê IoT Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**IoT (Internet of Things) protocols** enable communication between IoT devices, gateways, and cloud platforms. These protocols are designed to handle the unique challenges of IoT systems, such as low power consumption, limited bandwidth, and constrained hardware resources.

IoT protocols operate across various layers of the OSI model, including physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers. They are optimized for specific use cases, such as low-power sensor networks, real-time communication, or cloud integration.
