# ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)

The **ESP-IDF** (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is the official development framework for the ESP32 family of SoCs. It provides APIs, drivers, and tools for building applications on Espressif‚Äôs microcontrollers, focusing on IoT, wireless connectivity, and embedded systems. ESP-IDF is widely used in robotics, automation, and consumer electronics, where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities are crucial.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

ESP-IDF is built on FreeRTOS and provides developers with low-level control over peripherals while maintaining a high-level API for rapid development. It includes libraries for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, power management, and cryptography, along with extensive debugging and build tools.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **FreeRTOS Integration**: Real-time OS support for multitasking.
- **Component-based Architecture**: Modular system for adding/removing drivers and middleware.
- **Connectivity**: Built-in Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) and Bluetooth (Classic & BLE).
- **Security**: TLS, SSL, secure boot, and flash encryption.
- **Cross-platform Toolchain**: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **OTA (Over-the-Air Updates)**: Built-in support for firmware updates.
