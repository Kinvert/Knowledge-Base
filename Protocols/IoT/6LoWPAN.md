# 6LoWPAN

**6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks)** is a networking adaptation layer that enables IPv6 packets to be sent over low-power, low-data-rate wireless networks, particularly those based on IEEE 802.15.4. It is widely used in IoT (Internet of Things), sensor networks, and robotics where constrained devices need efficient, scalable communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

6LoWPAN bridges the gap between the resource-heavy IPv6 protocol and constrained wireless devices with limited bandwidth and processing power. By compressing and fragmenting IPv6 packets, it makes it feasible to run IP-based communication directly on low-power networks. This enables seamless integration of embedded devices into the wider Internet.
