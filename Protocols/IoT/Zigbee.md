# Zigbee

Zigbee is a low-power, low-data-rate wireless communication protocol designed for short-range mesh networking of devices such as sensors, actuators, and embedded controllers. It is widely used in home automation, industrial control, and IoT applications where power efficiency and reliable mesh connectivity are critical.

## üåê Overview

Zigbee operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard at the physical and MAC layers and adds network, security, and application layers to enable secure, scalable, and robust mesh networks. It supports thousands of nodes with self-healing capabilities and is optimized for low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-powered devices.

## üß∞ Key Features

- Operates in 2.4 GHz (worldwide), 900 MHz (Americas), and 868 MHz (Europe) ISM bands
- Data rates up to 250 kbps (2.4 GHz band)
- Supports mesh, star, and tree topologies
- Robust security with AES-128 encryption
- Low power consumption suited for battery-operated devices
- Supports device roles: Coordinator, Router, End Device
- Interoperability via Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL)
- Supports device commissioning and network formation
