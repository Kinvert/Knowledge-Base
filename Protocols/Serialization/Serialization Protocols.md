# üóÉÔ∏è Serialization Protocols

## üß≠ Overview

**Serialization protocols** define the rules for converting structured data into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, and reconstructed. Serialization is essential for communication between distributed systems, data storage, and inter-process communication.

Serialization protocols vary in terms of performance, size efficiency, human readability, and compatibility. Choosing the right protocol depends on factors like the use case, programming language support, and the need for speed or readability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of Serialization Protocols

1. **Data Encoding**:
   - Convert structured data (e.g., objects, arrays) into a serialized format for transmission or storage.

2. **Cross-Language Support**:
   - Many protocols are designed to work across multiple programming languages.

3. **Compactness**:
   - Some protocols prioritize small payload sizes for bandwidth efficiency.

4. **Human Readability**:
   - Formats like JSON and XML are human-readable, while others like Protobuf and Avro are binary and optimized for machines.

5. **Schema Support**:
   - Some protocols (e.g., Avro, Protobuf) use schemas to define data structures, ensuring compatibility and validation.
