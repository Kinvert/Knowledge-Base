# Canny Edge Detection

The **Canny Edge Detection** algorithm is a multi-stage method in computer vision designed to detect edges in images with high accuracy and minimal false detections. It was introduced by John F. Canny in 1986 and is widely used in robotics, image processing, and computer vision systems due to its balance of performance, efficiency, and robustness.

## üîé Overview

Canny is a **feature detection algorithm** specifically for identifying edges in images. It uses gradient-based techniques combined with filtering and non-maximum suppression to achieve thin, accurate edges. Its popularity stems from its ability to reduce noise while still preserving critical structural information in an image.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Noise Reduction**: Uses a Gaussian filter to smooth the image and reduce noise sensitivity.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Finds the intensity gradient of the image to identify areas with strong intensity changes.
- **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Thins edges by removing pixels that are not local maxima along the gradient direction.
- **Double Thresholding**: Applies two thresholds (high and low) to classify strong and weak edges.
- **Edge Tracking by Hysteresis**: Links weak edges to strong ones if they are connected, improving continuity.
