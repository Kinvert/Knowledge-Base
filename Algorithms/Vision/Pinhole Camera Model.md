# Pinhole Camera Model

The **Pinhole Camera Model** is a simplified mathematical model that describes how a 3D point in the world is projected onto a 2D image plane through a single point (the "pinhole"). It is widely used in computer vision, robotics, and photogrammetry for tasks involving image formation, camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, and pose estimation.

## üìö Overview

In the pinhole model, the camera is treated as a simple box with a tiny hole on one side. Light from the scene enters through the pinhole and projects an inverted image on the opposite side. Although idealized (real cameras have lenses), this model is foundational for understanding and implementing many computer vision algorithms.

The central equation is:

`x = K [R | t] X`

Where:  
- `X` is the 3D point in world coordinates  
- `[R | t]` is the extrinsic matrix (rotation and translation)  
- `K` is the intrinsic camera matrix  
- `x` is the 2D image point in homogeneous coordinates

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Intrinsic Parameters**: Describe the internal camera geometry (focal length, principal point, skew)  
- **Extrinsic Parameters**: Describe the camera's position and orientation in the world  
- **Projection Matrix**: Combines intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to map 3D ‚Üí 2D  
- **Homogeneous Coordinates**: Used to represent points and transformations consistently  
- **Radial/Tangential Distortion**: Not modeled in basic pinhole camera but added during calibration

- [[Pose Estimation]] from known 2D-3D correspondences  
- [[Structure from Motion]] and [[SLAM]]

- Inaccurate at wide fields of view without corrections  
- Real cameras often require more complex models
