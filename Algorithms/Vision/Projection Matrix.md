# Projection Matrix

The **Projection Matrix** is a fundamental concept in computer vision and robotics used to project 3D world points onto a 2D image plane. It encapsulates both the intrinsic parameters of a camera (how the camera sees) and the extrinsic parameters (where the camera is and how it's oriented in the world). This matrix is essential in tasks such as [[Pose Estimation]], [[SfM]], [[SLAM]], and [[Triangulation]].

## üìö Overview

The projection matrix defines the transformation from 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates using the equation:

`x = P * X`

Where:  
- `X` is a 3D point in homogeneous coordinates  
- `P` is the 3√ó4 projection matrix  
- `x` is the projected 2D image point in homogeneous coordinates  

The matrix `P` is constructed as:

`P = K [R | t]`

Where:  
- `K` is the **intrinsic matrix** (camera parameters)  
- `[R | t]` is the **extrinsic matrix** (camera pose: rotation and translation)

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Intrinsic Matrix (K)**: Includes focal length, principal point, and skew  
- **Extrinsic Matrix ([R | t])**: Describes the camera's position and orientation  
- **Homogeneous Coordinates**: Enables projection using matrix multiplication  
- **Perspective Division**: Final image coordinates are obtained by normalizing the result (dividing by the last element)  
- **Multiple View Geometry**: Projection matrices are key to stereo and multi-view setups

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Converting 3D points into 2D image coordinates  
- Computing reprojection error in optimization problems  
- [[Triangulation]] from multiple views  
- [[SfM]]: Estimating camera poses and 3D structure  
- Rendering synthetic views in simulations

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Provides a unified framework for projection  
- Encapsulates both camera calibration and pose  
- Works with any pinhole camera setup  
- Extensively used in academic and real-world vision systems

## ‚ùå Cons

- Assumes perfect pinhole model unless corrected for distortion  
- Can be numerically unstable without proper calibration  
- Requires accurate K, R, and t to be meaningful  
- Nonlinear optimization may be needed for refinement
