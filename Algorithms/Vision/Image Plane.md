# Image Plane

The **Image Plane** is the 2D surface within a camera model where 3D world points are projected to form an image. It is a conceptual tool used in the **[[Pinhole Camera Model]]** and other projection models to understand how cameras convert the real world into 2D imagery.

## üìö Overview

In the pinhole camera abstraction, light rays from 3D objects pass through a single point (the camera's center or focal point) and intersect the image plane. This intersection defines where and how the 3D point appears in the final image. The image plane is positioned perpendicular to the camera‚Äôs optical axis and contains the origin of pixel coordinates (usually at the principal point).

It serves as the destination of the projection transformation, where coordinates are measured in pixels and referenced for image processing tasks like feature detection, segmentation, and reconstruction.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Principal Point**: The point where the optical axis intersects the image plane  
- **Pixel Coordinates**: Coordinates of points projected onto the image plane  
- **Intrinsic Matrix (K)**: Maps camera frame points to the image plane  
- **Projection Equation**: `x = K [R|t] X`, where `x` lies on the image plane  
- **Focal Length**: Determines the scale of projection on the image plane

## üß∞ Use Cases

- 2D projections in [[Pose Estimation]]  
- Reprojecting 3D landmarks during [[SLAM]]  
- Simulating synthetic views for [[Camera Calibration]]  
- Mapping sensor data onto visual imagery  
- Computing reprojection error during optimization

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Simplifies modeling of how images are formed  
- Forms the foundation of most vision algorithms  
- Directly corresponds to camera sensor output  
- Easily understood and applied in both real and simulated systems  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Idealized: ignores sensor-specific noise, blur, and distortion  
- Inaccurate for wide-angle or fisheye lenses without corrections  
- 2D simplification‚Äîloses depth and occlusion information
