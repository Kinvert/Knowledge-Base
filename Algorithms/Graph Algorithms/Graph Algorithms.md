# üï∏Ô∏è Graph Algorithms

**Graph algorithms** are designed to solve problems involving graphs ‚Äî data structures made of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They are critical in computer science, robotics, networking, logistics, and many other domains.

This note serves as an index for various graph-related algorithm categories and key examples.

## üß† What is a Graph?

A **graph** consists of:

- **Vertices (nodes)**: The entities or points.
- **Edges (links)**: The connections between vertices (can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted).

Graphs can represent anything from social networks and maps to circuits and dependency structures.
