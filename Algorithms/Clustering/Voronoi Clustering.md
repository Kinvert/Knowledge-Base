# üìå Voronoi Clustering

**Voronoi Clustering** is a spatial clustering technique that uses **Voronoi diagrams** to partition space into regions based on proximity to a set of seed points (sites). Each point in space belongs to the region (cell) of the nearest seed point. While not always a clustering method by itself, Voronoi partitioning is often applied in clustering, path planning, mesh generation, and sensor network organization.

## üß† Summary

- **Concept**: Divides space into non-overlapping regions around each seed point where any location inside a region is closer to that seed than to any other.
- **Output**: A tessellation of space into polygonal (2D) or polyhedral (3D) cells.
- **Main Use in Clustering**: Assigning data points to the nearest seed region or centroid.

## üéØ Applications

- Sensor coverage and deployment (e.g., robotics, wireless networks)
- Path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Image segmentation
- Terrain modeling and mesh generation
- Data clustering in spatial datasets
- Nearest neighbor search acceleration
- Particle simulation and material science

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Seed Selection**: Choose initial cluster centers (e.g., random, k-means centroids).
2. **Voronoi Tessellation**: Create cells where each region includes all points nearest to a seed.
3. **Assignment**: Assign data points to the cluster of the seed point whose cell contains them.
4. **(Optional)**: Update seed locations (if iterative method used like k-means).
