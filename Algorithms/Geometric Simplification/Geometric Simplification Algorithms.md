# Geometric Simplification Algorithms

**Geometric Simplification Algorithms** reduce the complexity of geometric data while preserving essential structure. These algorithms are used in robotics, GIS, computer graphics, CAD, and computer vision for tasks like path simplification, mesh reduction, and map generalization. The goal is to balance accuracy, efficiency, and memory requirements depending on the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Simplification is necessary when geometric data contains too many details (e.g., sensor noise, highly detailed maps, or dense meshes). Algorithms vary in whether they target **polylines**, **meshes**, or **point clouds**. Robotics uses simplification to reduce computational load for path planning and mapping.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Tolerance**: Maximum deviation allowed between original and simplified geometry.
- **Feature Preservation**: Maintain sharp corners, important contours, or topology.
- **Dimensional Scope**: Applied to lines, surfaces, or 3D meshes.
- **Trade-Offs**: Simplification improves efficiency but risks losing accuracy.
