# Line Decimation Algorithm

The **Line Decimation Algorithm** is used to simplify polylines by reducing the number of points while maintaining an approximation of the original shape. This is widely used in robotics, mapping, computer graphics, and GIS where raw line data (e.g., sensor readings, paths, contours) can be noisy, overly detailed, or too large for efficient processing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Line decimation reduces data size without significantly altering geometry. The choice of algorithm depends on trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. In robotics, it is often applied in path simplification (e.g., for navigation) or map post-processing (e.g., reducing LIDAR scan density for visualization).

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Polyline Simplification**: Approximate a polyline with fewer vertices.
- **Error Metrics**: Algorithms define tolerance thresholds (e.g., maximum distance from original line).
- **Trade-Off**: Simpler polylines are easier to process but may lose detail.
- **Applications**: Mapping, path planning, cartography, compression of vector data.
