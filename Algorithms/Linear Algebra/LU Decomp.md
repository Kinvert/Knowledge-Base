# LU Decomp

LU Decomposition is a fundamental matrix factorization technique that expresses a square matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U). This method is widely used in numerical linear algebra for solving systems of equations, inverting matrices, and computing determinants. It is a core building block for many algorithms used in control theory, robotics, simulation, and more.

## üß† Overview

LU Decomposition transforms a matrix `A` into two matrices `L` and `U` such that `A = LU`, where:
- `L` is a lower triangular matrix (with ones on the diagonal if using Doolittle‚Äôs method),
- `U` is an upper triangular matrix.

This method simplifies complex matrix operations by reducing them to operations on triangular matrices, which are computationally more efficient to handle.

## üìò Core Concepts

- **Triangular Matrices:** Matrices with zero elements either above or below the main diagonal.
- **Forward and Backward Substitution:** Methods used to solve linear systems once `L` and `U` are known.
- **Pivoting:** A technique used to improve numerical stability, often yielding LUP decomposition.
- **Determinant Calculation:** The determinant of `A` can be found as the product of the diagonals of `U`.
