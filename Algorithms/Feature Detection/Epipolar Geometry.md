# Epipolar Geometry

Epipolar Geometry describes the intrinsic projective geometry between two views of a 3D scene. It is a fundamental concept in stereo vision and structure-from-motion, used to constrain and match corresponding points between two camera images. In robotics and computer vision, it enables depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction.

## üìö Overview

When a 3D point is observed by two different cameras, its projections lie along corresponding epipolar lines. The relationship between these lines is captured by the **essential matrix** (when intrinsic parameters are known) or the **fundamental matrix** (when they are not). These matrices encode the relative pose (rotation and translation) between the two views.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Epipole**: The projection of one camera center onto the other camera's image plane.
- **Epipolar Line**: The line on the second image where the corresponding point must lie.
- **Fundamental Matrix (F)**: Encodes the epipolar geometry without knowing camera intrinsics.
- **Essential Matrix (E)**: Encodes epipolar geometry assuming known camera intrinsics.
- **Triangulation**: Estimating 3D point position from two projections.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Stereo vision and depth estimation
- Visual Odometry (VO)
- Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
- SLAM initialization
- Matching features across views
- Outlier rejection using epipolar constraint

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Constrains feature matching to 1D lines, improving robustness
- Enables depth estimation from stereo pairs
- Key part of multi-view geometry and 3D reconstruction

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Sensitive to noise and outliers in point correspondences
- Assumes rigid scenes with static cameras
- Fails with degenerate configurations (e.g., planar scenes)
