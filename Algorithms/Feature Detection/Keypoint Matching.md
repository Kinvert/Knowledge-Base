# Keypoint Matching

**Keypoint Matching** is a fundamental technique in computer vision and robotics used to find correspondences between distinctive features (keypoints) across multiple images or 3D scans. It plays a crucial role in tasks such as SLAM, 3D reconstruction, motion tracking, and object recognition.

---

## 📚 Overview

Keypoint matching involves detecting distinctive points in images or point clouds and matching them based on similarity in their descriptors. By establishing correspondences between views, systems can compute geometric transformations, estimate camera motion, or reconstruct scenes.

The process typically includes:
1. **Keypoint Detection** (e.g., [[ORB]], [[SIFT]], [[FAST]])
2. **Descriptor Computation** (e.g., [[BRIEF]], [[FREAK]], [[SURF]])
3. **Descriptor Matching** (e.g., [[FLANN]], brute-force)
4. **Geometric Verification** (e.g., [[RANSAC]])

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Keypoints**: Salient, repeatable features detected in images or point clouds  
- **Descriptors**: Vector representations of keypoints used for comparison  
- **Matching Strategy**: Methods for comparing descriptors, such as L2 distance or Hamming distance  
- **Outlier Rejection**: Identifies and removes incorrect matches (often with [[RANSAC]])  
- **Cross-Check / Symmetric Matching**: Ensures match validity from both image directions

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Feature-based SLAM and Visual Odometry  
- 3D Structure from Motion (SfM)  
- Panorama stitching  
- Image-based localization and relocalization  
- Robot perception and scene understanding  
- Loop closure detection  

---

## ✅ Pros

- Lightweight and fast with binary descriptors like ORB  
- Works in both 2D and 3D domains  
- Scale- and rotation-invariant (with certain detectors like SIFT)  
- Enables sparse but robust geometric estimation  

---

## ❌ Cons

- Sensitive to lighting and perspective changes  
- High outlier rates without good verification (e.g., no RANSAC)  
- Dense matching not supported—only sparse correspondences  
- Descriptor choice significantly affects accuracy and speed
