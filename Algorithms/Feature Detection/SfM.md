# Structure from Motion (SfM)

**Structure from Motion (SfM)** is a computer vision technique that reconstructs 3D structure from a series of 2D images taken from different viewpoints. It simultaneously estimates both the scene geometry and the camera motion, and is commonly used in robotics, photogrammetry, and 3D modeling.

## üìö Overview

SfM works by identifying feature correspondences across multiple images and using geometric constraints to infer the 3D structure of the scene and the trajectory of the camera. It's foundational in offline visual SLAM systems and serves as a precursor to more real-time capable algorithms.

SfM typically includes:
1. **Feature Detection & Matching** ([[SIFT]], [[ORB]], etc.)
2. **Camera Pose Estimation** ([[Pose Estimation]])
3. **Triangulation** of matched points into 3D
4. **Bundle Adjustment** for global optimization

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Epipolar Geometry**: Relationship between image pairs used in camera pose recovery  
- **Triangulation**: Reconstructs 3D points from matching 2D points  
- **Camera Calibration**: Needed for accurate reconstructions  
- **Incremental or Global Approaches**: Add cameras one by one or optimize all at once  
- **Bundle Adjustment**: Minimizes reprojection error across all views

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Offline 3D mapping and modeling  
- Aerial photogrammetry (e.g., drone surveys)  
- Archaeological and architectural reconstructions  
- Autonomous vehicle map building  
- Preprocessing for SLAM or 3D localization

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Provides dense or sparse 3D reconstructions from 2D images  
- Accurate camera motion and 3D structure estimation  
- Works with unordered image sets  
- Can operate without GPS or IMU

## ‚ùå Cons

- Computationally expensive, especially with many images  
- Not suitable for real-time applications without adaptation  
- Requires good feature matches and sufficient parallax  
- Sensitive to lighting and texture variation
