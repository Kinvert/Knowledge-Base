# Feature Detectors

**Feature Detectors** are algorithms used to identify distinct, repeatable points or regions in images—commonly referred to as keypoints. These points are critical for a variety of robotics and computer vision applications such as image matching, visual SLAM, object tracking, and 3D reconstruction.

## 📚 Overview

A good feature detector identifies keypoints that are robust to changes in scale, rotation, illumination, and viewpoint. Once detected, these keypoints can be described by [[Feature Descriptors]] and used in [[Keypoint Matching]], [[Structure from Motion]], or [[Visual Odometry]].

Feature detection is the first stage in many vision pipelines and directly affects performance in downstream tasks.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Corner Detection**: Keypoints are often corners or blobs, where intensity changes sharply  
- **Scale Invariance**: Detect features at different resolutions  
- **Rotation Invariance**: Robust to camera orientation changes  
- **Repeatability**: Same features should be detected across multiple views  
- **Non-max Suppression**: Used to select prominent features while discarding redundant ones

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Feature-based SLAM systems like [[ORB-SLAM]]  
- 3D reconstruction from images  
- Object and scene recognition  
- Augmented reality (AR) marker tracking  
- Image registration and stitching  

---

## ✅ Pros

- Enables robust matching across frames  
- Many detectors are lightweight and real-time capable  
- Foundational for geometry-based vision methods  
- Binary detectors (e.g., ORB, BRISK) are fast and efficient  

---

## ❌ Cons

- Sensitive to texture-less or repetitive regions  
- Detector performance varies under changing conditions  
- False positives may occur, requiring further filtering  
- Cannot represent dense image regions (sparse by design)
