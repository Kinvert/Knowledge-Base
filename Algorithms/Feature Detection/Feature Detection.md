# 🔎 Feature Detection

**Feature detection** is a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics that involves identifying key points, corners, edges, blobs, or other structures in an image that are informative and distinctive. These features are used for tasks like image matching, object recognition, tracking, SLAM, and 3D reconstruction.

This note serves as a central hub for feature detection algorithms and related topics.

## 🧠 What is a Feature?

A **feature** is a point or region in an image that can be reliably located and matched across different views or transformations. Examples include:

- **Corners** (e.g., Harris corners)
- **Edges** (e.g., Canny edge detector)
- **Blobs / Regions** (e.g., SIFT keypoints, SURF keypoints)

## 📌 Key Attributes of a Good Feature

- **Distinctiveness**: Easily distinguishable from surrounding pixels.
- **Invariance**: Robust to changes in scale, rotation, illumination, or viewpoint.
- **Repeatability**: Detected reliably across multiple images of the same scene.
