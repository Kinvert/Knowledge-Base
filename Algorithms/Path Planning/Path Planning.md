# üõ§Ô∏è Path Planning

**Path Planning** refers to the process of determining a feasible route or sequence of movements for an agent (such as a robot or vehicle) to navigate from a start point to a goal while avoiding obstacles. It is a cornerstone of robotics, autonomous driving, and AI navigation systems.

## üß† Summary

- **Goal:** Find an optimal or feasible path in an environment.
- May consider static or dynamic obstacles, kinematics, and cost metrics.
- Used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, games, drones, and logistics.

| A* (Graph-based)             | Grid or graph-based maps                       | Guarantees optimal path (if heuristic admissible), efficient | Can struggle in high-dimensional or continuous spaces |
| Dijkstra (Graph-based)       | Known map with uniform cost                    | Finds shortest path, simple                     | Slower than A* when heuristic available         |
| Breadth First Search (Graph) | Small discrete spaces                          | Complete, simple                               | Inefficient in large or weighted graphs         |
| RRT (Sampling-based)         | High-dimensional, complex environments         | Handles complex, continuous spaces well         | Paths can be sub-optimal, post-processing needed |
| PRM (Sampling-based)         | Multi-query problems in static environments    | Efficient for repeated planning                 | Slow for dynamic obstacles                      |
| Potential Field (Reactive)   | Real-time obstacle avoidance                   | Fast, low computational load                    | Can get stuck in local minima                   |
| CHOMP / TrajOpt (Optimization)| Smooth, kinematic-aware paths                  | Generates smooth, feasible trajectories         | Requires good initial guess, slower for large spaces |
| Genetic / Ant Colony (Meta)  | Complex, non-convex spaces                     | Good for global exploration                     | Slow convergence, computationally intensive     |
