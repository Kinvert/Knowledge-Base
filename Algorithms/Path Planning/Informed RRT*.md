# üå≥ Informed RRT*

**Informed RRT\*** is an enhancement of [[RRT*]] that focuses the sampling process within a subset of the configuration space that could potentially contain better solutions, thereby improving convergence toward the optimal path.

---

## üß† Summary

- Reduces unnecessary sampling by restricting exploration to an ellipsoidal subset once a solution is found.
- The ellipsoid is defined by the current best solution's cost and the start and goal positions.
- Retains asymptotic optimality while accelerating convergence.
- Particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces where uniform sampling is inefficient.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Informed sampling:** Only samples states that could improve the current best solution.
- **Asymptotically optimal:** Like [[RRT*]], guarantees convergence to the optimal path as samples ‚Üí ‚àû.
- **Ellipsoidal sampling region:** Dynamically updates as better paths are found.

## üöÄ Applications

- Autonomous vehicles navigating complex environments.
- High-DOF robotic arms with tight motion constraints.
- UAVs and drones operating in cluttered 3D spaces.

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Faster convergence to an optimal solution than standard RRT*.
- Focuses computation where it's most likely to improve the solution.
- Reduces time wasted on irrelevant parts of the space.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Requires a feasible solution before informed sampling begins.
- Performance gain depends on the quality of the heuristic and the environment.
