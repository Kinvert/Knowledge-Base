# üå≥ RRT-Connect

**RRT-Connect** is an extension of the classic [[RRT]] (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) algorithm designed to improve performance in difficult path planning problems by using *bidirectional tree growth* and an aggressive connection strategy.

---

## üß† Summary

- RRT-Connect grows two trees simultaneously: one from the start and one from the goal.
- When one tree extends toward a random sample, it attempts to connect to the other tree as far as possible along that direction.
- Known for fast performance in high-dimensional spaces with narrow passages.
- Not asymptotically optimal (unlike [[RRT*]]), but highly practical for many applications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Bidirectional search:** Two trees grow toward each other to reduce search time.
- **Connect extension:** Instead of small incremental steps, RRT-Connect tries to extend as far as possible along a straight line until it hits an obstacle.
- **Fast runtime:** Often finds a feasible solution quickly, especially in cluttered environments.

## üöÄ Applications

- Robotic arm planning in confined workspaces.
- Mobile robot navigation in cluttered indoor environments.
- Real-time applications where feasible paths matter more than optimal ones.

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Very fast at finding feasible paths.
- Bidirectional growth is effective for narrow passages.
- Simple to implement with good practical performance.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Paths tend to be suboptimal and require post-processing (e.g., smoothing).
- Not asymptotically optimal ‚Äî it doesn't guarantee convergence to the best path with increasing samples.
