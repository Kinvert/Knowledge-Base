# 🤖 CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning)

**CHOMP** is an optimization-based motion planning algorithm designed to generate smooth, collision-free trajectories by minimizing a cost functional that accounts for both obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness. CHOMP is especially known for its gradient-based trajectory refinement.

## 🧠 Summary

- Introduced by Ratliff, Zucker, Bagnell, and Srinivasa in 2009.
- Uses functional gradient descent to minimize trajectory cost.
- Separates trajectory costs into smoothness and obstacle cost components.
- Often used in manipulation tasks requiring high-quality motion.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Works with continuous trajectories (time-parameterized).
- Compatible with kinematic and dynamic constraints.
- Gradient-based optimization: produces smooth paths suitable for execution.
- Can refine initial trajectories generated by other planners (e.g., [[RRT]], [[PRM]]).
- Integrates well with [[MoveIt]] and [[ROS]] ecosystems.

## 🚀 Applications

- Robot arm motion planning where trajectory smoothness is critical.
- Manipulation tasks in cluttered environments.
- Post-processing of rough paths generated by sampling-based planners.

---

## 🏆 Strengths

- Produces very smooth, executable trajectories.
- Can handle complex obstacle environments.
- Efficient gradient-based optimization process.

---

## ⚠️ Weaknesses

- Sensitive to initial trajectory: poor initialization may lead to local minima.
- Computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems.
- Not designed for global exploration — best as a trajectory optimizer rather than a standalone planner.
