# üå≥ ABIT* (Anytime Batch Informed Trees)

**ABIT\*** is a sampling-based motion planning algorithm that blends features of [[BIT*]] (Batch Informed Trees) and [[Informed RRT*]], providing *anytime* performance ‚Äî meaning it can return a feasible solution quickly and then progressively refine it toward optimality as time allows.

---

## üß† Summary

- Designed for scenarios where a quick feasible path is needed, but refinement toward optimality is desired if more computation time is available.
- Combines batch processing (like BIT*) with anytime characteristics (returns early feasible paths).
- Uses informed sampling techniques to focus search on promising regions.
- Asymptotically optimal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Anytime planning:** Delivers a path early, improves as more time is given.
- **Batch + incremental:** Samples in batches but outputs paths incrementally as solutions are refined.
- **Informed sampling:** Focuses computation on regions that could yield better solutions.
- **Graph-based search:** Efficient exploration using heuristics on a sparse graph.

## üöÄ Applications

- Robotics systems where both fast initial paths and long-term refinement matter (e.g., autonomous vehicles, manipulators).
- Real-time systems that must start moving quickly but want to improve motion over time.
- Dynamic environments where conditions can change as planning continues.

## üèÜ Strengths

- Produces quick initial solutions and improves them over time.
- Efficient in high-dimensional configuration spaces.
- Combines strengths of BIT* and Informed RRT*.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- More complex implementation than simpler planners (e.g., [[RRT-Connect]]).
- Performance benefits most apparent in large or complex planning spaces.
