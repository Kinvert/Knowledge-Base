# üå≤ RABIT* (Regionally Accelerated Batch Informed Trees)

**RABIT\*** (Regionally Accelerated Batch Informed Trees) is an advanced, sampling-based motion planning algorithm that extends [[BIT*]] by introducing *regional acceleration*. The core idea is to dynamically adjust the density of samples in promising regions of the space, accelerating convergence to an optimal solution.

---

## üß† Summary

- Builds upon the BIT* framework.
- Dynamically focuses sampling in regions likely to yield better solutions.
- Retains asymptotic optimality while reducing the number of unnecessary samples.
- Leverages heuristic-informed search with adaptive regional refinement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Regionally accelerated sampling:** Focuses sampling in specific regions based on current best solutions and heuristic cost-to-go estimates.
- **Batch-based incremental planning:** Like BIT*, but smarter in how batches are allocated spatially.
- **Asymptotically optimal:** Guaranteed convergence to the optimal solution as samples ‚Üí ‚àû.
- **Efficient collision checking:** By focusing samples, fewer checks are required on average.

## üöÄ Applications

- High-DOF robot motion planning (e.g. humanoid arms, legged robots).
- Autonomous vehicles in complex environments.
- UAV navigation through cluttered airspace.
- Real-time or resource-constrained planners needing faster convergence.

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Faster convergence than BIT* in many scenarios.
- Reduced computational effort through regional focus.
- Suitable for high-dimensional and complex environments.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- More complex to implement than BIT* or FMT*.
- Still requires good heuristics for maximum benefit.
- May not outperform simpler methods in low-dimensional or easy spaces.
