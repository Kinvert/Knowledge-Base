# Puffer Environments

**Puffer Environments** are a collection of lightweight, easy-to-use reinforcement learning environments designed to facilitate rapid prototyping and benchmarking of RL algorithms. Built to complement libraries like [[PufferLib]], these environments emphasize simplicity, modularity, and minimal dependencies while providing diverse control and navigation tasks.

They are particularly useful for researchers and engineers exploring RL methods in simulated robotics and control domains without the complexity of heavy simulation platforms.
