# RL Environment

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, the *environment* is the simulated or real-world system with which the agent interacts. It defines the rules of the task, including how the agent‚Äôs actions influence the state of the world and what observations and rewards the agent receives.

The environment is typically modeled as a [[MDP]] (Markov Decision Process), and serves as the core testing ground where an agent learns through trial and error.

---

## üìö Overview

The RL environment exposes two key functions: `reset()` to start a new episode, and `step(action)` to execute an action and return a tuple containing `observation`, `reward`, `done`, and `info`. It handles state transitions, observation generation, and reward computation internally.

Popular RL frameworks like `Gymnasium` and `PettingZoo` define standard APIs for interacting with environments.

## üß† Core Concepts

- `Observation`: What the agent perceives from the environment  
- `Action`: What the agent chooses to do at each timestep  
- `Reward`: The feedback signal guiding agent learning  
- `Episode`: A sequence of interactions ending in a terminal state  
- `MDP (Markov Decision Process)`: Formal model of the environment  
- `Environment Dynamics`: Define how the environment evolves with actions  
- `Reset`: Initializes the environment to a starting state  
- `Step`: Executes an action and returns results

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Training agents for robotic manipulation or navigation  
- Simulating tasks before deploying to real-world hardware  
- Benchmarking algorithm performance on standardized tasks  
- Generating datasets via interaction for offline RL  
- Multi-agent experimentation and coordination

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Modular and decoupled from the learning algorithm  
- Enables fast, repeatable training in simulation  
- Easy to modify reward functions or dynamics  
- Can replicate real-world physics or simplified tasks

## ‚ùå Cons

- Poor simulation fidelity limits real-world transfer  
- Complex environments are harder to model and debug  
- Requires domain expertise to design realistic tasks  
- Inconsistent APIs across libraries can create friction
