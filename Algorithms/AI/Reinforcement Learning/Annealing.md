# Annealing (in AI / Reinforcement Learning)

Annealing in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to the gradual adjustment of parameters‚Äîsuch as learning rate or exploration rate‚Äîover time, inspired by the physical process of *annealing* in metallurgy. The goal is to allow an algorithm to explore broadly at first and then progressively refine its search toward optimal or stable solutions as it "cools."

## üß† Overview

Annealing is a meta-optimization technique that helps balance *exploration* and *exploitation*. It‚Äôs commonly used in reinforcement learning for:
- Decreasing the learning rate over time (learning rate annealing)
- Reducing randomness in policy exploration (epsilon annealing in [[Epsilon-Greedy]])
- Controlling temperature in softmax-based policies (temperature annealing)

The underlying principle comes from *Simulated Annealing*, a stochastic optimization inspired by the physical cooling process where high energy states are slowly reduced to reach a low-energy equilibrium.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

- **Temperature (T):** A parameter controlling randomness. High T encourages exploration, low T favors exploitation.
- **Cooling Schedule:** Defines how T (or analogous variables) decreases over time. Can be linear, exponential, or adaptive.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Annealing allows more random actions early in training and more deterministic ones later.
- **Learning Rate Annealing:** Gradual reduction in learning rate to stabilize convergence.
- **Entropy Regularization:** Sometimes used with annealing to maintain sufficient exploration during policy optimization.

Example schedules:
- Linear decay: `T = T0 * (1 - t / Tmax)`
- Exponential decay: `T = T0 * exp(-k * t)`
