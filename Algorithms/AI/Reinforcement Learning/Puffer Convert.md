# Puffer Convert

**Puffer Convert** is a utility tool within the Puffer ecosystem designed to facilitate data format conversions commonly encountered in reinforcement learning and simulation workflows. It helps translate between various data representations to ensure compatibility across different libraries, frameworks, and environments.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Converts data types such as tensors, arrays, and observations between formats.  
- Bridges data between Puffer environments and external RL libraries or tools.  
- Supports batch and single-instance conversion for efficient processing.  
- Simplifies integration by automating tedious manual data transformations.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Data Interoperability**: Enables smooth transitions between differing data structures used in RL frameworks.  
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple samples or trajectories.  
- **Format Compatibility**: Converts to/from numpy arrays, PyTorch tensors, and other common formats.  
- **Environment Integration**: Adapts raw environment outputs to formats expected by RL agents or algorithms.

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Feeding Puffer environment observations into neural network models requiring tensor inputs.  
- Converting actions or states between Puffer and third-party RL libraries.  
- Preprocessing or postprocessing data during training and evaluation loops.  
- Facilitating debugging and visualization by converting data into human-readable formats.

## ✅ Pros

- Streamlines multi-framework RL workflows.  
- Reduces errors from manual data conversion.  
- Supports efficient batch operations.  
- Lightweight and easy to integrate within Puffer pipelines.

---

## ❌ Cons

- Primarily focused on data conversion, limited to Puffer-related formats.  
- Less useful outside of Puffer ecosystem or if custom data formats are used.
