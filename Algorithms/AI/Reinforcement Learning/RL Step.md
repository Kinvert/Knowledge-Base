# RL Step

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, the `step()` function is the core interaction point between an agent and its environment. It executes one timestep of the simulation or real-world task, processing the agent‚Äôs chosen action and returning the consequences.

The `step()` function is typically called in a training loop and is fundamental to any RL framework. It is responsible for transitioning the environment‚Äôs state, returning the new observation, reward, done signal, and additional info.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- `Action Input`: The decision made by the agent for the current timestep  
- `State Transition`: The environment updates its internal state based on the action  
- `Observation`: What the agent sees after the action is applied  
- `Reward`: Feedback from the environment indicating how good the action was  
- `Done`: Boolean flag indicating if the episode has ended  
- `Info`: Optional dictionary with debugging or auxiliary data  

Typical signature:
`observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)`

---

## üìö Example Use

- `action = policy(observation)`  
- `obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)`  
- `if done: env.reset()`  

This pattern is consistent across most environments, including `Gymnasium`, `Isaac Gym`, `PyBullet`, and `PettingZoo`.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Iterative interaction with the environment  
- Collecting data for training or replay buffers  
- Logging rewards and episode statistics  
- Driving animations or hardware actuators  
- Multi-agent coordination by sequential stepping  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Standard interface across libraries  
- Enables episodic learning and trajectory generation  
- Flexible enough to wrap simulations, games, or real robots  
- Works with both discrete and continuous actions  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Assumes synchronous, step-by-step control (less real-time)  
- Misuse (e.g. forgetting to reset) leads to broken episodes  
- Inconsistent `info` usage across environments  
- Real-time constraints in robotics require careful timing
