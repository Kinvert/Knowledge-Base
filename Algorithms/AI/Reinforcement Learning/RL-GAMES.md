# RL-Games
RL-Games is a PyTorch-based reinforcement learning (RL) library that is lightweight, flexible, and highly optimized for training in simulation. It is widely used in robotics research (especially with NVIDIA Isaac Gym and Isaac Lab) and supports multiple continuous-control algorithms with strong GPU acceleration.

---

## üß≠ Overview
RL-Games was originally developed by Denis Tarasov at NVIDIA to provide an efficient RL training library for large-scale parallel simulation environments. Unlike more general-purpose RL libraries, RL-Games is tightly focused on performance in robotics, control, and continuous-action environments.

## üß© Core Concepts
- **Simulation-Oriented**: Designed for large-batch training in GPU-accelerated simulators like Isaac Gym and Isaac Lab.
- **Algorithm Coverage**: Implements PPO, SAC, DDPG, A2C, and others, with optimized variants for robotics.
- **Policy Flexibility**: Supports feedforward MLPs, recurrent policies (LSTMs/GRUs), and custom architectures.
- **Config Driven**: YAML/JSON-based experiment setup; easily reproducible.
- **Domain Randomization**: Natively supports sim2real robustness training.
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Designed to scale across large parallel environments.
