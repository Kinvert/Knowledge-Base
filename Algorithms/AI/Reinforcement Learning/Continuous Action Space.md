# Continuous Action Space

A **Continuous Action Space** refers to an environment where the agent's actions are represented by continuous values, often real numbers, rather than discrete sets of predefined actions. This type of action space is common in robotics, control systems, and many real-world applications requiring fine-grained control.

## üîç Overview

- Actions can take any value within a continuous range, often represented as vectors of real numbers.  
- Contrasts with **Discrete Action Spaces**, where actions are limited to a finite set of choices.  
- Requires algorithms capable of handling continuous outputs, such as policy gradient methods.  
- Common in tasks like robotic arm manipulation, autonomous driving, and physical simulations.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Action Vector**: A multi-dimensional vector where each element is a continuous variable (e.g., torque, velocity).  
- **Bounded or Unbounded**: Actions can be constrained within limits (e.g., [-1,1]) or unconstrained depending on the environment.  
- **Policy Representation**: Policies output continuous distributions (e.g., Gaussian) or deterministic continuous values.  
- **Exploration**: Noise addition (e.g., Gaussian or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise) is often needed to explore the action space effectively.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robot joint angle control or torque control.  
- Autonomous vehicle steering, throttle, and braking.  
- Simulated physics-based tasks (e.g., locomotion in MuJoCo).  
- Continuous control problems in games and simulations.

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Enables precise and smooth control in complex environments.  
- More realistic modeling of many physical systems compared to discrete actions.  
- Compatible with advanced RL algorithms like [[SAC]], [[DDPG]], and [[TD3]].

## ‚ùå Cons

- More challenging to explore due to infinite action possibilities.  
- Requires algorithms that can model continuous probability distributions or deterministic functions.  
- May demand more sample complexity and careful tuning.
