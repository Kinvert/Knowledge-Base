# Neural MMO

**Neural MMO** is a massively multi-agent reinforcement learning environment inspired by massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. It provides a large-scale, persistent world where many agents interact, compete, and cooperate, enabling research in complex multi-agent behaviors, emergent strategies, and lifelong learning.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Simulates an open-world game environment with resources, combat, and survival mechanics.  
- Supports hundreds to thousands of agents concurrently interacting in a shared persistent world.  
- Designed to study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) at scale.  
- Focuses on emergent complexity, cooperation, competition, and social behavior.  

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Multi-agent Setup**: Multiple independent agents with their own policies and observations.  
- **Persistent World**: Agents exist over many episodes, with evolving environment state.  
- **Partial Observability**: Agents see only a limited area around them.  
- **Resource Management**: Agents gather resources, manage health, and engage in combat.  
- **Heterogeneous Agents**: Supports different classes or roles with unique abilities.  
- **Reward Structure**: Often sparse and shaped by survival, resource gathering, and combat success.
