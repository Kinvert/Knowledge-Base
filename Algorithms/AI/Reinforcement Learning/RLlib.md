## üîç Overview

- Provides implementations of classic and state-of-the-art RL algorithms.  
- Supports both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning.  
- Modular architecture allows easy customization of components like policies, replay buffers, and environments.  
- Designed to work seamlessly with popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).  
- Often used in research, benchmarking, and prototyping of RL methods.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Modularity**: Separation of policy, environment, replay buffer, and optimizer components.  
- **Algorithm Support**: Includes methods such as [[DQN]], [[PPO]], [[TRPO]], [[TD Learning]], and many more.  
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Provides utilities to manage multiple interacting agents.  
- **Integration**: Compatible with standard RL environments (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and custom setups.  
- **Experiment Management**: Tools for logging, checkpointing, and hyperparameter tuning.
