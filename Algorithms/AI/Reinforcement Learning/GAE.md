# GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)

**Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)** is a method in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for computing more accurate and less noisy estimates of the **advantage function**, which is used in many policy gradient algorithms like [[PPO]], [[A2C]], and [[TRPO]].

GAE balances the trade-off between bias and variance in advantage estimation by introducing a decay factor Œª (lambda), smoothing the advantage signal across multiple time steps.

## üìö Overview

In policy gradient methods, accurate estimation of the advantage `A(s, a)` is critical for stable and efficient learning. GAE refines advantage estimates by taking a weighted sum of Temporal Difference (TD) residuals across multiple steps:

`A_t^GAE(Œ≥, Œª) = ‚àë_{l=0}^‚àû (Œ≥Œª)^l Œ¥_{t+l}`

Where:
- `Œ¥_t = r_t + Œ≥ V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)` is the TD error
- `Œ≥` is the discount factor
- `Œª` controls the trade-off between bias (low Œª) and variance (high Œª)

## üß† Core Concepts

- `Advantage Function`: Measures how good an action is compared to the average  
- `TD Error`: Temporal difference used in advantage computation  
- `Œª (Lambda)`: Decay parameter controlling bias-variance tradeoff  
- `Œ≥ (Gamma)`: Standard reward discount factor  
- `Bootstrapping`: Uses future value estimates to reduce variance  
- `Online Computation`: GAE can be computed efficiently over trajectories

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Stabilizing updates in actor-critic algorithms like [[PPO]]  
- Improving sample efficiency in on-policy methods  
- Generating better training signals for continuous control  
- Reducing noise in sparse or delayed reward environments  
- Balancing exploration and exploitation in multi-step scenarios

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Significantly reduces variance in advantage estimates  
- Improves training stability and convergence speed  
- Simple and computationally efficient to implement  
- Flexible control via Œª to tune bias/variance

## ‚ùå Cons

- Sensitive to choice of Œª and Œ≥  
- Improper tuning can lead to poor performance  
- Adds a layer of complexity to basic actor-critic methods  
- Not directly applicable to off-policy algorithms without modification
