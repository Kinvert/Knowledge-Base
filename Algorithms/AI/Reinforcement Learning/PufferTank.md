# PufferTank

**PufferTank** is a physics-based reinforcement learning environment included in [[Puffer Environments]], designed to challenge RL agents with continuous control tasks. It simulates a simple tank-like vehicle that must be controlled using forward and rotational movements, making it a minimal yet effective testbed for motor control, reward shaping, and curriculum learning.

## üîç Overview

- Part of the [[PufferLib]] ecosystem built to simplify and scale multi-agent and single-agent RL experiments.  
- Focuses on physical locomotion, stability, and control dynamics.  
- Ideal for testing new RL methods on interpretable, deterministic behavior.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Continuous Action Space**: Agents control velocity and turn rate.  
- **Observation Space**: Includes position, orientation, velocity, angular velocity, etc.  
- **Reward Function**: Encourages movement toward a goal or performing stable maneuvers.  
- **Environment Dynamics**: Simulates friction, inertia, and response delay.  
- **Curriculum Learning Support**: Compatible with gradual difficulty ramp-up for better training.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Benchmarking new RL algorithms like [[PPO]], [[TD Learning]], or [[DQN]] on low-complexity environments.  
- Testing reward shaping techniques.  
- Prototyping control logic for real-world mobile robot simulations.  
- Visualizing RL agent learning in interpretable environments.

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Fast simulation time, great for iteration and debugging.  
- Simple yet rich enough to test RL fundamentals.  
- Low computational overhead compared to full physics environments like [[Isaac Gym]] or [[PyBullet]].

## ‚ùå Cons

- Too simple for generalization to complex robotics problems.  
- May not surface higher-level coordination challenges (e.g. multi-limb control).  
- Lacks sensor noise or stochasticity present in real-world scenarios.
