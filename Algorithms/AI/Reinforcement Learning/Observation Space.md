# Observation Space

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, the **Observation Space** defines the set of all possible observations or states that an agent can perceive from the environment at each time step. It represents the agent's sensory input and forms the basis for decision making.

The nature and structure of the observation space significantly affect how the agent learns and performs.

## üîç Overview

- The observation space can be **discrete**, **continuous**, or **hybrid** depending on the problem domain.  
- Observations can be raw sensor readings, processed features, images, or other data representations.  
- Defines what the agent "sees" at each step, affecting policy and value function inputs.  
- Closely linked to the **state space**, but the observation may only be a partial or noisy representation of the true environment state (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process - POMDP).

## üß† Core Concepts

- `Discrete Observation Space`: Finite set of possible observations (e.g., categorical sensors)  
- `Continuous Observation Space`: Infinite, often vector-valued observations (e.g., position, velocity)  
- `High-Dimensional Observations`: Images, point clouds, or multi-modal sensor data  
- `Partial Observability`: Observations may not fully describe the environment state  
- `State Estimation`: Techniques like filters or memory used to infer true state from observations

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robot localization using camera or LiDAR data  
- Autonomous driving with multi-sensor fusion inputs  
- Game-playing agents with pixel-based observations  
- Industrial automation with sensor arrays  
- Simulated environments where ground-truth states may or may not be available

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Flexible representation allowing rich sensory input  
- Can encode complex environment details  
- Enables learning from raw data when combined with function approximators

## ‚ùå Cons

- High-dimensional spaces can increase sample complexity  
- Partial observability complicates policy learning  
- Requires careful preprocessing or feature extraction for effective learning
