# A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)

**A3C**, or **Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic**, is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that combines **policy-based** and **value-based** methods. It uses multiple asynchronous agents (workers) running in parallel to explore the environment, which stabilizes training and improves sample efficiency.

Developed by DeepMind in 2016, A3C became a breakthrough in deep RL due to its scalability and performance across a wide range of tasks, particularly in environments with high-dimensional observations like Atari and 3D simulators.

## üß† Overview

A3C works by:
- Running multiple actor-critic agents in parallel across environments
- Each worker updates a **shared global network** asynchronously
- Uses **Advantage Estimation** to reduce variance in policy gradient updates
- Trains both **policy (actor)** and **value function (critic)** networks

Unlike experience replay-based methods like [[DQN]], A3C is **on-policy** and does not require a replay buffer, making it suitable for non-stationary or memory-constrained environments.

## üß™ Use Cases

- Solving high-dimensional visual tasks (e.g., Atari, 3D environments)  
- On-policy training in environments where experience replay is impractical  
- Robotics tasks with continuous or discrete actions  
- Multi-agent systems and parallel simulations  
- Curriculum learning or domain randomization scenarios
