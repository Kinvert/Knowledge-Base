# PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is a powerful and widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that combines the strengths of **policy gradient methods** with improved training stability. Developed by OpenAI, PPO is an **on-policy**, **actor-critic** algorithm that strikes a balance between performance and ease of implementation.

PPO is favored for its simplicity, sample efficiency, and strong empirical performance across a range of tasks‚Äîfrom robotics to games.

## üìö Overview

PPO improves policy learning by limiting how much the policy can change between updates, thus avoiding large, destabilizing updates. Instead of directly maximizing the objective, it uses a **clipped surrogate objective** that penalizes excessive updates.

This approach allows for **multiple epochs of minibatch updates** using the same collected data while maintaining stability.

## üß† Core Concepts

- `On-policy`: Learns from data sampled from the current policy  
- `Actor-Critic`: Separate networks for policy (actor) and value estimation (critic)  
- `Clipped Objective`: Prevents large updates by clipping the probability ratio  
- `Advantage Estimation`: Uses [[GAE]] to reduce variance in policy gradient  
- `Surrogate Objective`: Maximizes expected reward while ensuring safe updates  
- `Entropy Bonus`: Encourages exploration by penalizing overly confident policies

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robotic control (e.g., joint manipulation, locomotion)  
- Sim-to-real transfer in physical systems  
- Policy learning in simulated environments like [[Isaac Gym]] or [[PyBullet]]  
- Game AI agents (Atari, MuJoCo, Unity environments)  
- Multi-agent cooperative or adversarial tasks

## üß† Pseudocode (Proximal Policy Optimization)

```cpp
// PPO High-Level Pseudocode in C++-like syntax
initialize_policy_parameters(theta)
initialize_value_function_parameters(phi)

for each iteration:
    trajectories = collect_trajectories(policy=theta)
    advantages = compute_advantages(trajectories, value_function=phi)

    for each epoch:
        for each minibatch in trajectories:
            r = policy_ratio(minibatch, theta, old_theta)
            clipped_objective = min(r * advantages, clip(r, 1 - epsilon, 1 + epsilon) * advantages)
            value_loss = mse(value_function(minibatch.states, phi), minibatch.returns)
            entropy_bonus = compute_entropy(policy(minibatch.states, theta))

            total_loss = -clipped_objective + c1 * value_loss - c2 * entropy_bonus
            update_parameters(theta, phi, total_loss)
```

```python
# PPO High-Level Pseudocode in Python-like syntax
initialize_policy_parameters(theta)
initialize_value_function_parameters(phi)

for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    trajectories = collect_trajectories(policy=theta)
    advantages = compute_advantages(trajectories, value_fn=phi)

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for minibatch in iterate_minibatches(trajectories):
            r = policy_ratio(minibatch, theta, old_theta)
            clipped_obj = torch.min(r * advantages, clip(r, 1 - eps, 1 + eps) * advantages)
            value_loss = mse(value_fn(minibatch.states), minibatch.returns)
            entropy = compute_entropy(policy(minibatch.states))

            total_loss = -clipped_obj.mean() + c1 * value_loss.mean() - c2 * entropy.mean()
            update(theta, phi, loss=total_loss)
```
