# PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is a powerful and widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that combines the strengths of **policy gradient methods** with improved training stability. Developed by OpenAI, PPO is an **on-policy**, **actor-critic** algorithm that strikes a balance between performance and ease of implementation.

PPO is favored for its simplicity, sample efficiency, and strong empirical performance across a range of tasks‚Äîfrom robotics to games.

## üìö Overview

PPO improves policy learning by limiting how much the policy can change between updates, thus avoiding large, destabilizing updates. Instead of directly maximizing the objective, it uses a **clipped surrogate objective** that penalizes excessive updates.

This approach allows for **multiple epochs of minibatch updates** using the same collected data while maintaining stability.

## üß† Core Concepts

- `On-policy`: Learns from data sampled from the current policy  
- `Actor-Critic`: Separate networks for policy (actor) and value estimation (critic)  
- `Clipped Objective`: Prevents large updates by clipping the probability ratio  
- `Advantage Estimation`: Uses [[GAE]] to reduce variance in policy gradient  
- `Surrogate Objective`: Maximizes expected reward while ensuring safe updates  
- `Entropy Bonus`: Encourages exploration by penalizing overly confident policies

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robotic control (e.g., joint manipulation, locomotion)  
- Sim-to-real transfer in physical systems  
- Policy learning in simulated environments like [[Isaac Gym]] or [[PyBullet]]  
- Game AI agents (Atari, MuJoCo, Unity environments)  
- Multi-agent cooperative or adversarial tasks

## ‚úÖ Pros

- High training stability  
- Simpler implementation than TRPO  
- Works well with continuous and discrete action spaces  
- Efficient use of collected data  
- Strong performance across many domains

## ‚ùå Cons

- On-policy: Less sample efficient than off-policy algorithms like DDPG or SAC  
- Sensitive to hyperparameters (e.g., clipping range, learning rate)  
- Requires a good balance of actor and critic updates  
- Cannot leverage replay buffers like off-policy methods
