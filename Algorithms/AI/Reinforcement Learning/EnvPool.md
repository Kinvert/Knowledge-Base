# EnvPool

**EnvPool** is a high-performance, multi-environment simulator pool designed for reinforcement learning. It enables massively parallel environment execution with minimal overhead, making it particularly useful for large-scale training and fast data collection.

---

## üîç Overview

- Written in C++ with Python bindings for minimal latency and maximum throughput.  
- Supports **vectorized** and **async** environment execution.  
- Compatible with Gym API and multiple RL frameworks.  
- Includes wrappers for environments from OpenAI Gym, DMControl, Atari, and more.  
- Designed to scale efficiently across CPUs and GPUs.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Vectorized Environments**: Run multiple environment instances in parallel as a batch.  
- **Zero-Copy Shared Memory**: Avoids bottlenecks in data transfer between C++ and Python.  
- **Asynchronous Sampling**: Allows agents to collect data from environments at different speeds.  
- **High-Throughput Sampling**: Designed to saturate RL pipelines with training data.  
- **Multi-threaded C++ Backend**: For ultra-fast simulation performance.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- High-speed training of RL agents with large batch sizes.  
- Training multiple agents in parallel across different scenarios.  
- Benchmarking or evaluating RL algorithms efficiently.  
- Real-time or near-real-time data generation for training environments.

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- **Extremely Fast**: Orders of magnitude faster than traditional Gym envs.  
- **Drop-in Compatibility**: Matches OpenAI Gym interface.  
- **Scalable**: Can run hundreds to thousands of envs concurrently.  
- **Supports Popular Suites**: Atari, DMControl, MuJoCo (via bindings), etc.

## ‚ùå Cons

- Limited to supported environments unless extended manually.  
- Requires installation of dependencies like CMake and a C++ compiler.  
- Not ideal for environments with complex rendering pipelines.
