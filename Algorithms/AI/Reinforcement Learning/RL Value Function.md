# RL Value Function

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, a *value function* estimates how good it is for an agent to be in a certain state, or to perform a certain action in a state. It is a key component in many RL algorithms and serves as the foundation for predicting expected future rewards.

There are two primary types of value functions:
- **State Value Function (`V(s)`):** Expected return from state `s`
- **Action Value Function (`Q(s, a)`):** Expected return from taking action `a` in state `s`

## üìö Overview

Value functions quantify long-term desirability:
- `V(s) = E[G_t | s_t = s]`
- `Q(s, a) = E[G_t | s_t = s, a_t = a]`

where `G_t` is the return from timestep `t` onward. These estimates are learned using dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, or Temporal-Difference (TD) learning.

The value function provides a baseline for evaluating policies and is often used to improve decision-making via policy iteration or actor-critic methods.

## üß† Core Concepts

- `V(s)`: State-value function  
- `Q(s, a)`: Action-value function  
- `Bellman Equation`: Recursive formulation for value functions  
- `TD Learning`: Updates values using bootstrapped estimates  
- `Bootstrapping`: Estimate return using next state's value  
- `Policy Evaluation`: Process of estimating value under a given policy  
- `Advantage`: `A(s, a) = Q(s, a) - V(s)` used in policy optimization

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Evaluating and improving policies  
- Serving as a critic in actor-critic methods  
- Enabling action selection (e.g. `argmax Q(s,a)`)  
- Providing low-variance targets in policy gradients  
- Function approximation using neural networks

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Enables sample-efficient updates  
- Can guide policy updates indirectly  
- Works well with both discrete and continuous environments  
- Improves stability in many RL algorithms

## ‚ùå Cons

- Hard to learn accurately in high-dimensional spaces  
- Sensitive to approximation errors  
- Bootstrapping introduces bias  
- Requires careful tuning of learning rate and exploration
