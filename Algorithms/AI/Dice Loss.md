# Dice Loss

Dice Loss is a metric-driven loss function used primarily in image segmentation tasks, especially in medical imaging and robotics perception. It is derived from the Dice Coefficient (also known as S√∏rensen‚ÄìDice index), a measure of set similarity. Dice Loss is particularly valuable when dealing with class imbalance and evaluating the overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentation masks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Dice Loss is used to train models where the prediction output is a mask or binary classification per pixel. It compares the similarity between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth mask by penalizing the model based on the degree of mismatch. It's especially effective when foreground pixels are sparse, which often leads to poor results with vanilla cross-entropy.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Dice Coefficient (DSC)**: Measures the overlap between two samples.
- **Formula**: `DSC = (2 * |A ‚à© B|) / (|A| + |B|)`
- **Dice Loss**: `1 - DSC`
- **Soft Dice**: A continuous, differentiable approximation of Dice Coefficient, allowing gradient-based optimization.
- **Handling Imbalance**: Works better than pixel-wise loss in highly imbalanced segmentation scenarios.
