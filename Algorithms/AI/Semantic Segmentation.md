# Semantic Segmentation

Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision task where each pixel in an image is classified into a predefined category. It is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and other domains requiring spatial understanding of visual data. Unlike object detection, semantic segmentation does not distinguish between separate instances of the same class‚Äîit simply assigns class labels to every pixel.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Pixel-wise Classification**: Assigning a class label to each individual pixel.
- **Class Map**: The result is a dense map with each pixel labeled (e.g. road, person, tree).
- **Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)**: Core architecture replacing fully connected layers with convolutions.
- **Encoder-Decoder Structures**: Common in segmentation (e.g. U-Net, SegNet).
- **Upsampling Techniques**: Includes transpose convolutions, bilinear upsampling, and pixel shuffle.
- **Loss Functions**: Often use [[Cross Entropy Loss]], [[Dice Loss]], or [[IoU Loss]] depending on task imbalance and overlap needs.
- **Softmax Activation**: Typically used for multi-class outputs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Semantic segmentation enables a robot or system to understand *what* is in the image and *where* it is. By providing fine-grained spatial context, it helps improve navigation, manipulation, and decision-making. It is computationally expensive and requires significant data labeling effort.
