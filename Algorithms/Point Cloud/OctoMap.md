# OctoMap

**OctoMap** is a probabilistic 3D mapping framework that represents environments using an **octree-based occupancy grid**. It enables efficient storage, updating, and querying of volumetric information from 3D sensor data, such as LiDAR or depth cameras, and is widely used in robotics for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and SLAM.

---

## üìö Overview

OctoMap compresses 3D space into a hierarchical tree of voxels (volumetric pixels), allowing memory-efficient representation of both occupied and free space. Each voxel stores a probability of occupancy, allowing the system to reason about sensor noise and uncertain observations. The resolution is adaptive: finer where needed, coarser elsewhere.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Octree Structure**: Space is recursively divided into octants; nodes represent voxels  
- **Probabilistic Occupancy**: Each voxel holds a log-odds probability of being occupied  
- **Sensor Integration**: Point clouds from sensors are inserted into the map with raycasting  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Sparse data storage; only occupied or uncertain regions stored  
- **3D Querying**: Allows fast collision checks, nearest neighbor queries, and visibility testing  
- **Resolution Scaling**: Tree depth controls map resolution dynamically

## üß∞ Use Cases

- 3D obstacle mapping for mobile robots and UAVs  
- Environment modeling for autonomous navigation  
- Collision checking in 3D space  
- Loop closure correction in SLAM pipelines  
- Autonomous exploration and path planning  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Scales well to large environments with adaptive resolution  
- Probabilistic reasoning handles sensor noise well  
- Efficient memory usage via sparse octree representation  
- Actively maintained with ROS/ROS2 integration  
- Useful for both online and offline mapping  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Assumes a static environment unless explicitly updated  
- May require tuning for sensor parameters and resolution  
- Not ideal for deformable or dynamic objects  
- Raycasting can be computationally intensive at high resolutions
