# Voxel Grid

A **Voxel Grid** is a 3D data structure that divides space into discrete, equally sized cubes (voxels). It is widely used in robotics and 3D perception tasks such as point cloud filtering, mapping, collision detection, and simulation. Voxel grids provide a balance between resolution and computational efficiency for representing 3D space.

## üìö Overview

In robotics, voxel grids simplify point cloud data by reducing the number of points while preserving geometric structure. This is particularly useful in real-time systems where raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR or RGB-D) is too dense or noisy for direct use. Voxel-based representations also underpin higher-level structures like OctoMap and ESDFs.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Voxel**: A volumetric pixel‚Äîtypically a cube with a defined size and position in space  
- **Downsampling**: Points within each voxel are replaced with their centroid (or one point), reducing point cloud density  
- **Occupancy Grids**: Each voxel may be marked as occupied, free, or unknown  
- **Resolution**: The size of each voxel, affecting both accuracy and memory usage  
- **Sparse or Dense Representation**: Can be implemented using arrays or hash maps, depending on scale and sparsity

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Downsampling noisy or redundant point cloud data  
- Fast collision checking in 3D environments  
- Input representation for 3D CNNs in deep learning  
- Spatial hashing for efficient neighbor search  
- 3D mapping in SLAM and navigation  
- Scene reconstruction and volumetric fusion

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Efficient storage and computation for large-scale 3D data  
- Reduces complexity of dense point clouds  
- Regular structure is well-suited for GPUs and spatial indexing  
- Works well with other spatial representations (Octree, TSDF, ESDF)  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Loss of fine detail if resolution is too coarse  
- Memory usage can still grow significantly at high resolutions  
- May introduce quantization errors  
- Fixed resolution may not adapt well to multi-scale environments
