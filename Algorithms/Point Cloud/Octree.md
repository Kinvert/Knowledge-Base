# Octree

An **Octree** is a hierarchical tree data structure used to partition 3D space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. Octrees are essential in 3D graphics, robotics, SLAM, and spatial indexing due to their ability to efficiently represent sparse volumetric data.

---

## 📚 Overview

Octrees divide a cube of space into eight smaller cubes (octants), each of which can be subdivided recursively. This structure enables **adaptive resolution**, allocating more detail only where needed. This makes octrees well-suited for large-scale 3D environments where uniform voxel grids would consume excessive memory.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Node and Octant**: Each node in the tree has up to 8 children, representing subdivisions of its cubic space  
- **Adaptive Resolution**: Finer subdivisions in areas with more detail or complexity  
- **Hierarchical Representation**: Spatial queries and updates are efficient due to logarithmic tree traversal  
- **Sparse Representation**: Only non-empty regions are stored, reducing memory use  
- **Occupancy or Scalar Values**: Nodes can store binary occupancy, probabilities, distances, or other metadata

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Efficient 3D mapping and SLAM (e.g. [[OctoMap]])  
- Real-time collision detection  
- 3D path planning and navigation  
- Ray tracing and visibility computations  
- Simulation environments and terrain modeling  
- Point cloud compression and search  

---

## ✅ Pros

- Extremely efficient in representing sparse 3D data  
- Supports fast queries like nearest neighbor or collision checks  
- Scales to large environments with minimal memory overhead  
- Well-suited for hierarchical data processing  
- Can be augmented to store semantic or probabilistic info  

---

## ❌ Cons

- Overhead in maintaining tree structure  
- Performance can degrade if tree becomes too unbalanced  
- Not as straightforward to parallelize as uniform grids  
- Poor locality compared to linear voxel grids in some GPU operations
