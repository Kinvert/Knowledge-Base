# üìà Kalman Filter

## üß≠ Overview

The **Kalman Filter** is an efficient recursive algorithm used for estimating the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. It is widely used in control systems, robotics, navigation, sensor fusion, and signal processing. The Kalman Filter provides optimal estimates (in the least-squares sense) for linear systems with Gaussian noise.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Recursive Estimation**: Updates estimates as new measurements arrive, without needing to store all past data.
- **Predict-Update Cycle**: Alternates between predicting the next state and updating the estimate with new measurements.
- **Optimal for Linear Gaussian Systems**: Minimizes mean squared error for linear systems with Gaussian noise.
- **Computationally Efficient**: Suitable for real-time applications.
- **Extensible**: Forms the basis for more advanced filters (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter).

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from IMUs, GPS, cameras, and other sensors.
- **Robotics**: Localization, mapping (SLAM), and motion tracking.
- **Navigation**: Aircraft, spacecraft, and autonomous vehicles.
- **Signal Processing**: Noise reduction and smoothing.
- **Finance**: Time series prediction and filtering.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Prediction Step**:  
   - Predict the next state and its uncertainty based on the system model.

2. **Update Step**:  
   - Incorporate new measurements to correct the prediction, reducing uncertainty.

3. **Mathematical Model**:  
   - Assumes a linear system with process noise and measurement noise, both Gaussian.
