# Bayes Filter

The **Bayes Filter** is a probabilistic algorithm used for estimating the state of a dynamic system in the presence of uncertainty. It is widely used in **robotics**, **sensor fusion**, and **SLAM** to continuously update a robot‚Äôs belief about its position or other hidden variables based on control inputs and sensor observations.

Bayes Filters provide the foundation for many common state estimation techniques such as the Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, and Histogram Filter.

## üß† Overview

Bayes Filters are recursive estimators. At each timestep, they:

1. **Predict** the new state using a motion model and previous belief.  
2. **Update** the belief based on sensor measurements and an observation model.

The algorithm applies **Bayes‚Äô Rule** to compute the posterior belief distribution over the system‚Äôs state.

## üî© Core Concepts

- **Belief (`bel(x)`)**: Probability distribution over the possible states.  
- **Prediction Step**: Uses control input and motion model to update belief.  
- **Correction Step**: Incorporates sensor data to refine belief using Bayes‚Äô Rule.  
- **Markov Assumption**: Future state depends only on the current state and action.  
- **Recursive Estimation**: Continuously refines belief with each timestep.

- SLAM systems (e.g., [[ORB-SLAM]], [[GMapping]])  
- Sensor fusion (e.g., GPS + IMU)  
- Object tracking in vision systems  
- Estimating dynamic environments or human motion
