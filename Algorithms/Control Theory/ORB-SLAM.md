# üî∑ ORB-SLAM

**ORB-SLAM** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF SLAM) is a feature-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. It is widely used in robotics and computer vision for real-time tracking and mapping using monocular, stereo, or RGB-D cameras.

---

## üß† Summary

- Developed initially by Ra√∫l Mur-Artal, Jos√© Mar√≠a M. Montiel, and Juan D. Tard√≥s.
- Uses ORB (Oriented FAST + Rotated BRIEF) features for efficient and robust performance.
- Works in indoor and outdoor environments.
- Supports monocular, stereo, and RGB-D camera configurations.
- Open-source under GPL license.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components

- **Tracking**: Estimates the camera pose frame-by-frame using ORB feature matching.
- **Local Mapping**: Builds and optimizes a local map with keyframes and landmarks.
- **Loop Closing**: Detects when the system revisits a previously mapped area and performs loop closure to correct accumulated drift.
- **Relocalization**: Quickly recovers from tracking failure using a bag-of-words place recognition system.

## üèÜ Strengths

- Real-time performance on standard CPUs.
- Robust in various environments with no need for external infrastructure.
- Effective relocalization and loop closure.
- Scales well to large environments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Performance degrades in feature-poor or highly dynamic environments.
- Monocular mode suffers from scale ambiguity.
- Sensitive to motion blur and low-texture scenes.
