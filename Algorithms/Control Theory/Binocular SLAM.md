# üëÄ Binocular SLAM

**Binocular SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using Stereo Vision) is a SLAM technique that uses **two synchronized cameras** (a stereo camera rig) to infer both camera motion and a 3D map of the environment. The stereo configuration allows it to estimate **absolute depth** directly from disparity between the left and right images, providing an immediate advantage over monocular systems.

## üß† Overview

- **Input**: Two calibrated and synchronized image streams from stereo cameras.
- **Goal**: Simultaneously estimate the position of the camera (localization) and create a map of the environment (mapping).
- **Primary Advantage**: Direct depth estimation from stereo disparity‚Äîno need to rely on motion for triangulation.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Stereo Calibration**: The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the two cameras are calibrated.
2. **Feature Detection**: Keypoints are extracted from both left and right frames.
3. **Stereo Matching**: Disparity is calculated from corresponding keypoints to determine depth.
4. **3D Point Generation**: Points are reconstructed in 3D directly from the disparity map.
5. **Tracking**: Motion is estimated by matching features across frames.
6. **Mapping**: A 3D map is created incrementally using the depth information and poses.
7. **Loop Closure and Optimization**: Reduces drift and refines the pose and map using global optimization.

| Feature                      | Binocular SLAM                      | Monocular SLAM                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Sensor Input**            | Stereo camera pair                  | Single camera                      |
| **Depth Estimation**        | Direct from disparity               | Triangulated from motion           |
| **Scale**                   | Absolute scale                      | Relative (scale drift possible)    |
| **Initialization**          | Immediate and stable                | Requires movement and feature-rich scene |
| **Cost**                    | Higher due to dual cameras          | Lower                              |
| **Accuracy**                | Generally more accurate             | Depends heavily on motion quality  |
| **Environmental Robustness**| Better performance in static scenes | Sensitive to low motion/texture    |
