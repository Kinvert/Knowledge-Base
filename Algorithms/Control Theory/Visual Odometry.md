# üöó Visual Odometry

**Visual Odometry (VO)** is the process of estimating the motion of a camera (or robot) over time by analyzing the sequence of images it captures. It plays a key role in robotics, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and drones where GPS may be unavailable or unreliable.

---

## üß† Summary

- VO estimates **incremental motion** (translation + rotation) from frame to frame using visual input.
- Typically used when wheel odometry, GPS, or IMU data are absent, unreliable, or complementary.
- Can work with monocular, stereo, or RGB-D cameras.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Visual Odometry

| Type           | Input                    | Notes                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Monocular VO** | Single camera             | Scale ambiguity; sensitive to drift        |
| **Stereo VO**    | Stereo camera pair        | Recovers metric scale                      |
| **RGB-D VO**     | RGB camera + depth sensor | Provides direct depth measurements         |
| **Visual-Inertial** | Camera + IMU             | Fuses VO with inertial data for robustness |

## üìå Key Steps in VO

1. **Feature detection and matching** (e.g., [[ORB]], [[SIFT]], [[FAST]])
2. **Motion estimation** (compute relative pose between frames)
3. **Outlier rejection** (e.g., RANSAC)
4. **Pose integration** (accumulate motion over time)
5. (Optional) **Bundle adjustment** (refine poses and 3D structure globally)

## üîÑ Comparison with SLAM

| Aspect                  | Visual Odometry                | [[SLAM]]                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Builds map?              | ‚ùå No (or minimal local map)   | ‚úÖ Yes (persistent map of environment) |
| Loop closure             | ‚ùå No                          | ‚úÖ Yes                            |
| Accumulated drift        | ‚úÖ Yes (drift grows over time) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Reduced by loop closure        |
| Complexity               | ‚ö° Lower                       | üê¢ Higher                        |
