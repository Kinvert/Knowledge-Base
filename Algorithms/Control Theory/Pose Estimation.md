# Pose Estimation

Pose Estimation is the process of determining the position and orientation (pose) of an object or camera in space relative to a known frame of reference. In robotics and computer vision, pose estimation is essential for localization, mapping, navigation, object tracking, and manipulation.

## üìö Overview

Pose estimation typically involves extracting features from sensor data (e.g., images, LiDAR), matching those features to a known model or environment, and solving for the transformation (rotation + translation) that aligns them. This transformation can be represented using matrices, quaternions, or Lie group elements (like SE(3)).

## üß† Core Concepts

- **6-DoF Pose**: A pose has six degrees of freedom‚Äîthree for translation (x, y, z) and three for rotation (roll, pitch, yaw).
- **PnP (Perspective-n-Point)**: Estimates the camera pose from 2D-3D correspondences.
- **ICP (Iterative Closest Point)**: Aligns 3D point clouds by minimizing distance between matched points.
- **SE(3)**: Mathematical representation of 3D rigid-body transformations.
- **Visual Odometry**: Tracks pose over time using camera data.
- **Inertial Odometry**: Tracks pose using IMU measurements.
