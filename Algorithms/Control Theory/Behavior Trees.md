# Behavior Trees

Behavior Trees (BTs) are a modular, hierarchical model for designing complex robot behaviors and decision-making systems. Widely used in robotics, gaming, and AI, BTs provide a structured yet flexible alternative to traditional finite state machines (FSMs), enabling dynamic, reactive control flows.

---

## üìö Overview

A Behavior Tree is composed of nodes arranged in a tree structure, where each node represents a behavior, condition, or control logic. Execution starts at the root and flows downward based on control flow rules. BTs excel at handling fallback logic, priorities, and reactive decision-making.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Root Node**: Entry point of the tree; starts the ticking process.
- **Control Flow Nodes**: Direct execution based on structure (e.g. Sequence, Selector).
- **Leaf Nodes**: Actions (e.g., move) or Conditions (e.g., battery low).
- **Ticking**: Trees are evaluated at regular intervals.
- **Return Status**: Nodes return `Success`, `Failure`, or `Running`.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Task-level robot autonomy (navigation, manipulation)
- Decision-making in mobile robots and drones
- Hierarchical mission control
- Game AI for NPCs
- Fallback and retry logic in multi-step tasks

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Highly modular and reusable
- Easy to debug and visualize
- Reactive and interruptible
- Clear separation of logic and action
- Scales better than FSMs for large tasks

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Requires good design to avoid complexity
- Can become deep/nested without clarity
- Not ideal for purely reactive systems without memory
