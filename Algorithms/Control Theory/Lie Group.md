# Lie Group

Lie Groups are continuous groups that are also differentiable manifolds, enabling smooth mathematical operations like interpolation and optimization. In robotics and computer vision, Lie Groups are fundamental for representing 2D and 3D transformations‚Äîsuch as rotations and poses‚Äîwith precision and mathematical consistency.

## üìö Overview

Lie Groups combine algebraic and geometric structures, making them ideal for modeling rigid-body transformations. Popular examples include SO(2), SO(3) for rotation, and SE(2), SE(3) for pose (rotation + translation). These groups enable efficient composition, inversion, and interpolation of transformations in a non-Euclidean space.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Group**: A set with associative composition, an identity, and inverses.
- **Manifold**: A smooth space that locally resembles Euclidean space.
- **Lie Algebra**: The tangent space at the identity element; allows linear operations.
- **Exponential / Logarithmic Maps**: Used to move between Lie Group and Lie Algebra.
- **Composition / Inversion**: Efficient, closed-form transformation chaining.

- **SE(2)**: 2D rotation + translation
- **SO(3)**: 3D rotation
