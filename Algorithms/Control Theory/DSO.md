# üé• DSO (Direct Sparse Odometry)

**DSO** stands for *Direct Sparse Odometry*, a direct monocular visual odometry method that estimates camera motion and scene geometry directly from image pixel intensities. It focuses on sparse, highly-informative points rather than full or semi-dense reconstructions.

---

## üß† Summary

- Fully direct, visual odometry technique: no keypoints or descriptors.
- Operates on a sparse set of image pixels with high gradient (informative regions).
- Formulates odometry as a windowed bundle adjustment problem, jointly optimizing poses and depths.
- Designed for robust, accurate tracking even in challenging lighting conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Sparse but direct:** Uses pixel intensities at selected points rather than feature points.
- **Photometric calibration:** Accounts for camera response, exposure time, and vignetting to improve accuracy.
- **Sliding window optimization:** Maintains and optimizes over a fixed-size window of keyframes.
- **Real-time capable:** Runs efficiently on standard CPUs.

## üöÄ Applications

- Visual odometry for mobile robotics and drones.
- SLAM backend or odometry module in larger navigation systems.
- AR / VR systems where monocular tracking is required.

## üèÜ Strengths

- High accuracy thanks to full photometric calibration and windowed optimization.
- Robust to low-feature environments where keypoint-based methods fail.
- No reliance on keypoint detection or matching.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Does not provide loop closure (odometry only, not full SLAM).
- Sparse output: no full or semi-dense 3D reconstruction.
- Sensitive to photometric inconsistencies if calibration is poor.
