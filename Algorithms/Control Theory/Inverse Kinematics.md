# Inverse Kinematics

**Inverse Kinematics (IK)** is the process of determining the joint parameters (such as angles or positions) required to place the end-effector of a robot at a desired position and orientation in space. It is the inverse of forward kinematics, which calculates the end-effector pose from known joint values.

IK is a foundational concept in robotics, animation, biomechanics, and control systems, enabling goal-directed movement for articulated systems.

## üß† Core Concepts

- `Forward Kinematics`: Computes the end-effector pose from joint states  
- `Inverse Kinematics`: Computes joint states from desired end-effector pose  
- `Analytical IK`: Closed-form solution, fast but only works for specific geometries  
- `Numerical IK`: Iterative optimization methods, slower but more flexible  
- `Redundancy`: Robots with more DOF than task dimensions can have infinite solutions  
- `Singularities`: Problematic configurations where small output motion requires large joint changes  
- `Constraints`: Joint limits, preferred configurations, collision avoidance

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robotic arm manipulation and pick-and-place  
- Humanoid walking and balance control  
- Camera reorientation and gaze tracking  
- Animation of characters and avatars  
- Exoskeleton and prosthetic control  
- Human motion imitation and teleoperation

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Allows precise end-effector control in task space  
- Applicable across many types of robots and linkages  
- Can be used with optimization for constraint-aware behavior  
- Widely supported in simulators and motion planning libraries

## ‚ùå Cons

- No solution may exist for certain goals (e.g. out of reach)  
- Multiple solutions can be ambiguous or unstable  
- Performance degrades near singularities  
- Requires accurate robot models (e.g. from `URDF`)
