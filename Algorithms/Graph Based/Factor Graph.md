# üîó Factor Graph

A **Factor Graph** is a type of bipartite graphical model that represents the factorization of a function (typically a probability distribution or cost function). It consists of **variable nodes** and **factor nodes**. Variable nodes represent unknown quantities, and factor nodes represent constraints or relationships among variables.

## üß† Summary

- **Structure**: Bipartite graph with variable nodes and factor nodes
- **Purpose**: Encode how a global function (e.g., joint probability or cost) decomposes into local functions (factors)
- **Applications**: Probabilistic inference, optimization, SLAM, error correction codes

## üéØ Factor Graphs in SLAM

In the context of **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**, factor graphs provide a compact and flexible way to represent the estimation problem. They capture the relationships (constraints) between robot poses, landmarks, and measurements.

- **Variable nodes**: Robot poses, landmark positions
- **Factor nodes**: Sensor measurements, odometry constraints, prior knowledge
- **Optimization goal**: Find variable assignments (poses, map) that best satisfy all factors (i.e., minimize error or maximize likelihood)

Factor graphs are the foundation of **graph-based SLAM**, where solving SLAM reduces to solving a sparse nonlinear least squares problem.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Factor Graph SLAM Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Pose Nodes**: Each robot pose at a given timestep is a variable node.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Landmark Nodes**: Each map feature (e.g., a landmark) is a variable node.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Factors**: Constraints such as odometry measurements, GPS updates, loop closures, or landmark observations.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Graph Construction**: As the robot moves and observes, new nodes and factors are added.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimization**: Solve for the configuration of variables that best satisfies all constraints using solvers like Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt.
