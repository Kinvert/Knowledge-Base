# BoW (Bag of Words)

Bag of Words (BoW) is a foundational model used to represent data, particularly text or image features, in terms of the frequency of discrete elements—typically words or visual features—without considering their order. In robotics and computer vision, BoW is most commonly used for visual place recognition and loop closure in SLAM systems.

---

## 📚 Overview

The BoW model transforms input data into a histogram of occurrences of words from a predefined dictionary. In visual SLAM, "words" are vector-quantized descriptors of image features like ORB or SIFT. This enables fast comparison and matching of scenes for recognizing previously visited places.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Vocabulary**: A set of representative feature vectors (visual words) learned via clustering (often k-means).
- **Histogram Encoding**: Each input image is converted into a histogram based on the frequency of visual words.
- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is sometimes used to weight rare visual words more heavily.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Extract features from images (e.g., ORB, SIFT).
2. Cluster features into a fixed-size vocabulary.
3. Represent each image as a histogram of visual word occurrences.
4. Compare histograms using similarity metrics (cosine similarity, L2 norm) for recognition.
