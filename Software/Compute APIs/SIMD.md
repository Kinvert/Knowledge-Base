# SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)

SIMD is a parallel computing paradigm where a single instruction operates on multiple data points simultaneously. It is widely used in robotics, computer vision, and numerical computations to achieve significant performance improvements by exploiting data-level parallelism.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

SIMD enables processors to perform the same operation on multiple data elements in parallel. Instead of executing the same instruction multiple times on individual data, SIMD applies it once across a vector or array of data. This model is especially useful in applications like signal processing, matrix operations, and deep learning.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Data-level parallelism (DLP):** Processing multiple pieces of data with the same operation simultaneously.  
- **Vectorization:** Transforming scalar operations into SIMD instructions.  
- **Registers:** Specialized SIMD registers hold multiple data elements (e.g., 128-bit, 256-bit, 512-bit registers).  
- **Instruction sets:** Processor-specific implementations of SIMD, such as Intel‚Äôs SSE, AVX, and ARM‚Äôs NEON.  
- **Throughput vs. Latency:** SIMD improves throughput (operations per cycle) but not always individual instruction latency.
