# OpenBLAS

**OpenBLAS** is an optimized open-source implementation of the **Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)** API. It provides high-performance linear algebra operations commonly used in scientific computing, machine learning, simulation, and robotics.

OpenBLAS is a drop-in replacement for the standard BLAS and offers highly optimized routines for various CPU architectures, including x86, ARM, and POWER. It's frequently used as the backend for higher-level libraries like [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]], and deep learning frameworks.

## üß† Overview

OpenBLAS implements routines for:
- Vector-vector operations (Level 1 BLAS)
- Matrix-vector operations (Level 2 BLAS)
- Matrix-matrix operations (Level 3 BLAS)

It includes architecture-specific optimizations (e.g., for Intel, AMD, ARM CPUs) and can be compiled with threading support for parallel execution using OpenMP or pthreads.

OpenBLAS is based on GotoBLAS2 and continues to be maintained by the community as a high-performance math kernel library.

## üß™ Use Cases

- Underlying math kernel for [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]], [[PyTorch]], [[TensorFlow]]  
- Robotics simulations (e.g., forward/inverse kinematics, dynamics)  
- Scientific computing (FEM, CFD, etc.)  
- Solving systems of linear equations  
- Matrix decompositions (SVD, LU, QR, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Capabilities

- Optimized for CPUs with SIMD instructions (SSE, AVX, NEON, etc.)  
- Multi-threaded matrix operations  
- Compatible with BLAS/LAPACK APIs  
- Supports single, double, complex, and double complex precision  
- Fast dense linear algebra on CPUs
