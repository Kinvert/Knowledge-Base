# SymPy

**SymPy** is a Python library for **symbolic mathematics**. Unlike numerical libraries like [[NumPy]] and [[SciPy]], which compute with floating-point numbers, SymPy represents mathematical expressions **symbolically** (as expressions that can be manipulated and transformed). This allows users to perform algebra, calculus, equation solving, and more, all in a programmatic and human-readable way.

SymPy is entirely written in Python and does not rely on external libraries. It is widely used in education, engineering, theoretical research, and occasionally in robotics for analytical derivations of kinematics or dynamics.

## üß† Overview

SymPy builds symbolic representations of mathematical expressions (e.g., `x + y`) which can be:
- Simplified
- Differentiated/integrated
- Converted to LaTeX or code (e.g., C or Python)
- Substituted or solved algebraically

It supports:
- Algebra
- Calculus (limits, integrals, derivatives)
- Matrices and linear algebra
- Equation solving
- Logic and set theory
- Geometry
- Series expansions
- Code generation

## üîê Security Considerations

SymPy supports functions like `sympify()` that convert strings into symbolic expressions, which **may use `eval()` internally** for parsing. This is potentially **unsafe** if arbitrary or untrusted input is passed, as it could execute malicious code.

**Key Safe Practice:**
Avoid passing raw user input to functions like `eval()`, `sympify()`, or `parse_expr()` without strict validation or sandboxing. Prefer working directly with expression trees or validated symbols.
