# cuSolver

**cuSolver** is a GPU-accelerated library from NVIDIA that provides high-performance **dense and sparse linear solvers** as part of the [[CUDA Toolkit]]. It supports various factorizations and solvers for systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and least-squares minimization‚Äîall optimized for execution on NVIDIA GPUs.

cuSolver is a key component in GPU-accelerated scientific computing, simulations, and machine learning workflows where linear algebra operations are a bottleneck.

## üß† Overview

cuSolver includes three main modules:

- **cuSolverDN** (Dense): LU, QR, Cholesky, SVD, and eigenvalue decompositions.
- **cuSolverSP** (Sparse): Solvers for sparse linear systems using CSR matrices.
- **cuSolverRF** (Refactorization): For matrix factorization reuse in iterative solvers.

These APIs offer performance comparable to CPU-based libraries like [[LAPACK]] and [[OpenBLAS]]‚Äîbut on GPUs‚Äîmaking them highly useful in large-scale robotics, FEM, and deep learning backends.
