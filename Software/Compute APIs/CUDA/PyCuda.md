# PyCUDA

**PyCUDA** is a Python wrapper for the NVIDIA [[CUDA Toolkit]] that enables easy and flexible GPU programming directly from Python. It allows developers to write CUDA kernels, manage GPU memory, and perform computations on NVIDIA GPUs without leaving the Python environment.

PyCUDA is popular in robotics, scientific computing, and machine learning for prototyping GPU-accelerated algorithms quickly while leveraging the power of CUDA.

## üß† Overview

PyCUDA exposes the full CUDA API to Python, including:
- Memory management (allocation, transfer, mapping)  
- Kernel compilation and execution  
- Streams and events for concurrency  
- Texture and surface references  
- Integration with NumPy for data exchange  

It offers tools to compile CUDA C kernels at runtime and utilities to simplify GPU resource management.
