# NVIDIA Driver

The **NVIDIA Driver** is essential software that allows an operating system to communicate with NVIDIA GPUs. It provides low-level control and enables support for features such as hardware acceleration, CUDA programming, graphics rendering, and deep learning.

For engineers and developers, especially in robotics, simulation, and machine learning, the correct NVIDIA Driver version is a foundational requirement to leverage GPU acceleration effectively.

## üß† Overview

NVIDIA Drivers include:

- Kernel modules to interface with the GPU hardware  
- Libraries to enable graphics and compute workloads  
- Support for [[CUDA Toolkit]], [[cuDNN]], [[TensorRT]], and [[OpenGL]]  
- Compatibility layers for various operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.)

The driver version must match or exceed the minimum version required by the target [[CUDA Toolkit]].

---

## üß™ Use Cases

- Running GPU-accelerated simulations (e.g., [[Isaac Gym]], [[PyBullet]])  
- Training deep learning models using [[PyTorch]] or [[TensorFlow]]  
- Deploying robotics systems with GPU processing  
- Running visualization tools using OpenGL or Vulkan  
- Enabling hardware-accelerated video encoding/decoding (NVENC, NVDEC)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Capabilities

- Enables communication between GPU hardware and user-space software  
- Supports multiple CUDA versions through forward compatibility  
- Provides device querying and diagnostics (e.g., `nvidia-smi`)  
- Required for GPU compute, graphics rendering, and video processing  
- Comes with a user-space and kernel-space component  
- Often installed via `apt`, `.run` file, or package managers like `pacman`, `yum`, or `choco`
