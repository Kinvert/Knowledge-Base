# cuFFT

**cuFFT** is NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated library for performing **Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)**. It is part of the [[CUDA Toolkit]] and provides highly optimized routines for 1D, 2D, and 3D FFTs on NVIDIA GPUs, enabling efficient frequency domain analysis in real-time signal processing, robotics, scientific computing, and machine learning.

## üß† Overview

cuFFT implements discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) for complex and real data in multiple dimensions. It supports single and double precision, batched transforms, and both in-place and out-of-place computations.

By leveraging the parallelism and memory bandwidth of modern NVIDIA GPUs, cuFFT delivers significant speedups over CPU-based FFT libraries such as FFTW.
