# CUDA Toolkit

The **CUDA Toolkit** is a comprehensive development suite provided by NVIDIA for building GPU-accelerated applications using the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform. It provides the essential tools, libraries, and compilers to write and optimize code for parallel execution on NVIDIA GPUs.

It enables developers to harness the massive parallelism offered by NVIDIA GPUs for applications in AI/ML, scientific computing, robotics, graphics, and simulation.

## üß† Overview

The toolkit includes:
- **`nvcc`** ‚Äî the CUDA compiler
- **CUDA Runtime** and **Driver APIs**
- Libraries for linear algebra, FFT, image processing, and deep learning
- Debugging and profiling tools
- PTX assembler and device emulators
- Header files, samples, and documentation

Supported programming languages include C, C++, Fortran, Python (via wrappers), and increasingly via frameworks like [[PyTorch]] or [[TensorFlow]].
