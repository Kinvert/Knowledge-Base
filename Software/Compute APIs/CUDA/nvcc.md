# nvcc

**`nvcc`** (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) is the compiler driver used to compile CUDA programs‚Äîsource files that include both host (CPU) and device (GPU) code. It wraps around standard host compilers (e.g., `gcc`, `cl`) and the NVIDIA `ptxas` assembler to generate executables or object files that include GPU kernels.

---

## üß† Overview

`nvcc` handles files that mix C++/C with CUDA-specific extensions (e.g., `__global__`, `__device__`, `__host__`). It's a key part of the CUDA development toolchain, often used to build high-performance GPU-accelerated applications.

Common input file extensions:
- `.cu` ‚Äî CUDA source file
- `.cuh` ‚Äî CUDA headers

It is part of the [[CUDA Toolkit]] and typically targets NVIDIA GPUs using the [[PTX]] intermediate representation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

- `nvcc file.cu -o my_program` ‚Äî Compile a single CUDA file  
- `nvcc -arch=sm_75 file.cu` ‚Äî Compile for specific GPU architecture  
- `nvcc -ptx file.cu` ‚Äî Compile to PTX only  
- `nvcc -c file.cu` ‚Äî Compile to object file  
- `nvcc -I./include -L./lib -lmylib file.cu` ‚Äî Add include and lib paths  
- `nvcc --help` ‚Äî Show help options
