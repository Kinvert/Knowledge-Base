# SciPy

**SciPy** is an open-source Python-based ecosystem for scientific and technical computing. It builds on top of [[NumPy]] and provides a vast array of high-level algorithms and functions for numerical integration, optimization, signal processing, linear algebra, statistics, and more.

SciPy is widely used in academia, engineering, data science, and robotics for prototyping, modeling, and solving real-world mathematical problems.

## üß† Overview

SciPy is organized into submodules that target specific domains of scientific computation. These include:
- `scipy.linalg` ‚Äì linear algebra
- `scipy.integrate` ‚Äì numerical integration
- `scipy.optimize` ‚Äì optimization routines
- `scipy.signal` ‚Äì signal processing
- `scipy.sparse` ‚Äì sparse matrices and solvers
- `scipy.fft` ‚Äì Fourier transforms
- `scipy.stats` ‚Äì statistical functions and distributions

SciPy functions are often thin wrappers over compiled libraries like [[OpenBLAS]], [[LAPACK]], and [[FFTW]], offering both speed and ease of use.
