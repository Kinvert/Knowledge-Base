# Notion vs Obsidian

A deep-dive comparison between **Notion** and **Obsidian**, focused on engineering workflows (especially algorithmic trading): data privacy, Jupyter/Jupyter-like workflows, plotting (including realtime), API/Webhook integrations for live data, and scripting/customization. Designed as an Obsidian-ready note for an engineering vault ‚Äî linkable, opinionated, and practical.

## üîé Overview
Notion is a cloud-first, collaborative all-in-one workspace focused on structured databases, team workflows, and embeddable content. Obsidian is a local-first, Markdown-based knowledge base focused on privacy, extensibility via plugins, and offline-first workflows. Notion excels at sharing and structured DBs across teams; Obsidian excels at offline ownership, plugin customization, and local compute integrations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Data privacy & LLM training (critical for proprietary algo IP)
- **Notion (cloud-first)**  
  - Notion states that, by default, customer data is **not** used to train Notion‚Äôs models and claims contractual protections with AI subprocessors to prevent Customer Data being used for model training. However, this is a contractual/terms-level guarantee tied to workspace/customer classifications and product configuration. For enterprise-grade assurance you must review workspace/contract clauses and any AI-subprocessor addenda.
  - Because Notion stores data in the cloud, you must trust their storage, access control, and any third-party integrations. Use enterprise/legal controls and DLP if your trading models or backtests are sensitive.
- **Obsidian (local-first)**  
  - Obsidian emphasizes local control: files live in your vault (local FS) and Obsidian‚Äôs web services (such as Obsidian Sync) can be optionally used; Obsidian Sync offers end-to-end encryption so Obsidian cannot read your synced content if E2EE is enabled. This model gives stronger control against provider-side LLM training unless you explicitly use cloud services that expose data.
  - Practically: if you want **guaranteed** non-exposure, host your vault on local encrypted storage, avoid third-party cloud providers, and limit use of cloud-based plugins or integrations that push data off-device.

**Takeaway:** For secret/proprietary trading models or datasets, Obsidian with E2EE/local filesystem control is inherently safer. Notion can be acceptable only if contractual enterprise protections are in place and you accept cloud storage tradeoffs.

## üß© Jupyter Notebook incorporation (how to actually run notebooks / code)
- **Notion**
  - Notion does **not** natively execute Jupyter notebooks. Typical workflows:
    - Embed a published notebook or an external hosted service (Binder, Deepnote, Observable, or JupyterHub) into a Notion page via `Embed`/iframe. The execution happens externally; Notion only displays the rendered view. This is suitable for dashboards and read-only snapshots.
    - Convert notebooks to Markdown/HTML (`nbconvert`, `jupytext`) and paste/export outputs into Notion ‚Äî good for archival copies but not interactive execution.
    - Some community scripts exist to upload notebook content automatically into Notion pages, but outputs/figures are often stripped or non-interactive. See `jupyter-to-notion` style tools for one-way pushes.
- **Obsidian**
  - Stronger local integration options via plugins and ‚Äúpaired‚Äù workflows:
    - Use `jupytext` to pair `.ipynb` with a markdown (`.md`) variant that lives in your vault. This gives a bi-directional text-format pathway (`jupytext --to md`). Edits in the Markdown can be synced back into a notebook.
    - Community plugins (recent/updating) such as **JupyMD / Jupy** allow editing and, in some cases, **executing code cells** from within Obsidian by talking to a local/remote Jupyter kernel or running Python directly. This is evolving quickly and makes Obsidian closer to a notebook editor.
    - Patterns: keep a local Python environment, run a kernel (or use `nbconvert`/`papermill` for batch runs), and have Obsidian render results (plots/images) saved to your vault for display in notes.
  
**Takeaway:** For interactive development and iterative algorithm work, Obsidian + `jupytext` or JupyMD + local kernels gives much tighter integration than Notion‚Äôs embed-and-view approach.

## üìà Plotting & realtime data (visualization for algo trading)
- **Notion**
  - Notion doesn't run plotting code natively. Strategies:
    - Embed external dashboards (Grafana, ObservableHQ, Deepnote, Plotly Dash, Streamlit/Flask UIs) into Notion via `Embed` or `public URLs` to show live charts.
    - Use the Notion API to push images or refresh content periodically: generate plots externally (Python/Matplotlib/Plotly), upload image files to Notion pages via the API, and refresh on a schedule (cron, serverless). This yields near-realtime snapshots but requires external compute and polling logic.
- **Obsidian**
  - Local-first plotting options:
    - Generate plots with Python scripts (Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh) and save them as image/SVG files inside the vault, then embed via `![[chart.png]]`. This allows full control and offline viewing.
    - For near-realtime charts, run a background process that pulls market data and updates image files in the vault. Obsidian will pick up file changes and re-render images automatically in the UI.
    - Use plugins that can render charts from embedded data blocks (e.g., Dataview + charting plugins, or use Obsidian Canvas + custom cards) ‚Äî plugin ecosystem is diverse, and there are plugins enabling rendering of CSV/JSON data as charts inside notes.
    - For interactive realtime dashboards, run a local web app (Streamlit/Plotly Dash/Bokeh) and either embed it (if using a browser with the page open) or snapshot images into Vault.
  - Important: when plotting from Python inside Obsidian, follow recommended restrictions: generate images programmatically, avoid embedding heavy interactive JS unless served via a local host.

**Realtime considerations:** Obsidian allows you to run local scripts (Python) to fetch APIs and update files; Notion requires an external server or hosted system to push updates via the Notion API or embeds.

---

## üîó How to tie in realtime data via APIs, webhooks, and streaming
- **Notion**
  - Has a formal REST API and supports **webhooks** for change notifications ‚Äî good for reacting to Notion-side changes (e.g., db updates). To display realtime market data you still need an external service: fetch market data (exchange APIs), push snapshots to Notion pages using the Notion API, or embed an externally served dashboard. Webhooks are useful to trigger downstream automation when human edits occur.
  - Typical architecture: Market data source ‚Üí compute layer (server, lambda, container) ‚Üí generate visual (image/plot) or serve a dashboard ‚Üí push to Notion or host and embed.
- **Obsidian**
  - No centralized API for vaults (the vault is a folder); realtime integration patterns rely on:
    - Local scripts/daemons that write files into the vault (images, CSV, JSON) ‚Äî Obsidian sees file changes and updates the UI.
    - Community plugin APIs (Templater, Templater API, CodeScript Toolkit, DataviewJS, Buttons) which allow in-note triggers that run JavaScript or shell commands in a controlled way. These can be used to call external APIs and write results back to notes.
    - Remote approach: run a small service that updates files in a cloud-backed vault (e.g., Git, Syncthing, Obsidian Sync) to have multi-machine access.
  - Typical architecture: Market data source ‚Üí local daemon/script (Python) ‚Üí write `plot.png`/`data.csv` into vault ‚Üí Obsidian auto-reloads.

**Latency & reliability:** For low-latency trading decisions, neither Notion nor Obsidian should be part of your execution loop. Use them for monitoring, analysis, and annotation. Execution/control should remain in low-latency, dedicated trading systems.

---

## üß∞ Scripting languages & customization
- **Notion**
  - Primary customization surfaces:
    - Notion API (REST) ‚Äî any language that can call HTTP REST (Python, JS/Node, Go, etc.) to read/write pages and databases.
    - Automations via Zapier/Make/Deepnote ‚Äî less code, quick connectors.
    - Embeds: host code (Streamlit, Dash, Observable, Grafana) elsewhere and embed.
  - Notion does not run arbitrary user scripts inside pages ‚Äî scripts run externally and talk to Notion via the API.
- **Obsidian**
  - Deep customization via plugins (TypeScript/JavaScript) and community plugins:
    - **Templater**: user scripting with JS templating for text generation and automation inside Obsidian notes.
    - **Dataview & DataviewJS**: query vault metadata and run JavaScript snippets to render dynamic content.
    - **CodeScript Toolkit / Custom plugins**: run local scripts, create buttons that execute scripts, etc. A lot of plugin APIs are JS/TS-based within the Obsidian plugin model.
    - External scripting: Python/rust/C++ programs that read/write files in the vault for heavy lifting (data ingestion, ML training). Use file-watchers or scheduled jobs to coordinate.
  - Developers can write full plugins in TypeScript using Obsidian‚Äôs plugin API for deeper integration (UI panels, commands, access to app state).

**Takeaway:** Notion = remote API-based automation. Obsidian = local-first scripting with in-note JS/TS plugin hooks + any external tooling via file I/O.

## üß™ Use cases toward Algo Trading (practical architectures & examples)
- **Research & note-taking (Obsidian recommended)**  
  - Keep strategy design docs, edge-case notes, and experiments in `.md` files. Run backtests locally; store results (CSV/plots) in vault and link notes to results with `![[backtest_2025-10-22/plot.png]]`.
  - Use `jupytext` to keep notebooks and markdown in sync so your reproducible pipeline is version-controlled.
  - Use a local script to pull OHLC/orderbook snapshots and save them into `data/` in vault; use a scheduled job to update plots.
- **Team monitoring & reporting (Notion recommended)**  
  - Publish post-trade reports or executive dashboards via Notion pages embedding Grafana/Streamlit dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.
  - Notion databases can hold summary metrics (daily PnL, exposure) pushed via the API for easy filtering and sharing.

**Architectural advice:** Keep execution and market-facing components out of Notion/Obsidian. Use them for analysis, observability, and decision-making support, not as trading engines.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools & Plugins to explore
- **Obsidian**
  - `jupytext` pairing workflow (external tool + vault).
  - **JupyMD** or similar plugins for executing cells (community-driven; verify security).
  - **Templater**, **Dataview**, **DataviewJS** for programmatic note generation and queries.
  - **CodeScript Toolkit**, Buttons plugin, and any plugin that allows running scripts or exposing API-like hooks.
- **Notion**
  - Notion REST API + official SDKs (Node/Python) for programmatic updates.
  - Use embeds with Streamlit, Deepnote, Grafana, or Observable for interactive charts and notebooks.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security & operational cautions (especially for algo trading)
- Do not store raw API keys or credentials in plain text within notes; use OS keyrings, environment variables, or a secrets manager.
- Avoid pushing proprietary model weights or sensitive training datasets to cloud-managed notes without enterprise legal review.
- Do not use Notion/Obsidian notes as a real-time execution control plane ‚Äî they are for analysis and visibility only.
- If using community plugins that execute code, audit them for network/file access ‚Äî they can become an exfiltration vector.
