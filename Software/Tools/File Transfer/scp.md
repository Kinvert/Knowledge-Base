# SCP (Secure Copy)

SCP (Secure Copy) is a command-line utility used to securely transfer files between hosts over a network. It relies on the [[SSH]] (Secure Shell) protocol for authentication and encryption, making it safer than older tools like `rcp`. Engineers often use SCP for moving logs, binaries, datasets, or configuration files to and from embedded devices, development boards, and remote servers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

SCP enables encrypted file transfer between a local machine and a remote system, or between two remote systems. It uses SSH under the hood, so if you have SSH access to a system, you can also copy files with SCP.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **SSH Integration**: SCP reuses SSH for authentication and encryption.
- **File Transfer Directions**:
  - Local ‚Üí Remote
  - Remote ‚Üí Local
  - Remote ‚Üí Remote (via local client as a middle point)
- **Command Syntax**: Typically `scp [options] source target`
- **Security**: Data is encrypted in transit.

|----------------|----------|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| SCP            | SSH      | Yes        | Quick, secure file transfer           | Simple but limited feature set          |
| [[SFTP]]       | SSH      | Yes        | Interactive file transfer sessions    | More flexible than SCP                  |
| [[rsync]]      | SSH      | Yes        | Efficient syncing of files/directories| Delta transfers, more options           |
| [[FTP]]        | FTP      | No (by default) | Legacy file transfers              | Insecure without [[FTPS]]/[[SFTP]]      |
| [[TFTP]]       | UDP      | No         | Simple, lightweight transfers         | Used in embedded/firmware contexts      |

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

- Uploading compiled binaries to a remote robotics platform
- Copying logs or datasets from a remote robot for analysis
- Deploying configuration files during development
- Transferring results from simulation servers to local machines

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths

- Simple command-line usage
- Built-in to most UNIX/Linux systems
- Encrypted and secure (leverages SSH)
- Works with existing SSH key infrastructure

---

## ‚ùå Weaknesses

- Less feature-rich than [[rsync]]
- No resume support for interrupted transfers
- Slower for large or incremental file syncs
- Limited interactive capabilities compared to [[SFTP]]

## üèÜ Summary

SCP remains a widely used tool for secure file transfers due to its simplicity and reliance on SSH. While newer alternatives like [[rsync]] and [[SFTP]] provide more features and flexibility, SCP is still an effective choice for quick, encrypted copying tasks in robotics, embedded systems, and server management.
