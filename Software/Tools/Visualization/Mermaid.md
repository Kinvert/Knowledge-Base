# üñºÔ∏è Mermaid Charts

## üß≠ Overview

**Mermaid** is an open-source JavaScript-based tool that enables users to create diagrams and visualizations using a simple, text-based syntax. It is widely used in Markdown environments (such as Obsidian, GitHub, and documentation wikis) to generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, class diagrams, and more directly from code blocks.

Mermaid helps bridge the gap between technical documentation and visual communication, making it easy to keep diagrams up-to-date and version-controlled alongside code.
