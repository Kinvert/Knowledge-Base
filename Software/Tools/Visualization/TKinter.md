# TKinter

**TKinter** is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library that ships with Python. It provides a simple and effective way to build cross-platform desktop applications with windows, buttons, labels, input forms, and more.

Though not typically used in high-performance robotics or visualization pipelines, TKinter can be useful for lightweight dashboards, control panels, and parameter tuning tools during development.

## 🧠 Overview

TKinter is a thin object-oriented layer over the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Because it's included with Python, it requires no additional installation on most systems.

It supports basic widgets like buttons, sliders, checkboxes, entry fields, and even some simple canvas drawing functionality, which makes it suitable for creating GUI frontends for robotics tools, logging viewers, configuration UIs, or simple project dashboards.

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Lightweight control UIs for robot tuning  
- Visualization of program state (e.g., sensor values, flags)  
- Parameter input panels for simulation or training  
- Educational or teaching tools  
- Quick GUI wrappers for scripts

---

## ⚙️ Capabilities

- Window creation with menus, dialogs, and layout managers  
- Widgets: `Button`, `Label`, `Entry`, `Checkbutton`, `Canvas`, etc.  
- Basic drawing (e.g., 2D canvas for visualization)  
- Event-driven programming (bindings for keyboard/mouse events)  
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- Compatible with Python 3.x
