# Visualization Tools

**Visualization Tools** play a crucial role in robotics, simulation, data science, AI/ML, and embedded systems by helping engineers debug, analyze, and communicate complex data visually. Whether it’s for camera streams, simulation states, neural network outputs, or real-time 3D environments, choosing the right visualization tool is essential for both development and presentation.

This page serves as an index of tools and frameworks commonly used for visualizing data, simulations, and environments in engineering and robotics.

## 🧠 Overview

Visualization tools vary in capability from low-level frame rendering (e.g., [[OpenCV]]) to full-blown 3D game engines. Their applications include:
- Robot state display and sensor feeds
- Simulated environment rendering
- Image and point cloud debugging
- Graph plotting and scalar metrics
- Reinforcement learning agent visualizers
- GUI-based parameter tweaking

Some tools focus on 2D visualization, others on interactive 3D scenes or headless logging/recording.
