# Raylib

**Raylib** is a simple and easy-to-use open-source C library for building 2D and 3D graphics applications, including games, simulations, and visualizations. It is designed to be lightweight, highly portable, and beginner-friendly — often used in education and prototyping environments. 

Raylib is gaining traction in projects involving reinforcement learning, simulations, and real-time rendering due to its simplicity and minimal dependencies. It is used by some projects like [[PufferLib]] for lightweight visualization, especially in headless or minimal-GUI environments.

## 🧠 Overview

Raylib was initially created for game development teaching but has evolved into a solid option for simulation rendering, embedded GUIs, and minimal visualizations.

Key design goals include:
- Pure C99 implementation with simple APIs
- Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD, WebAssembly)
- Embeddable into other frameworks or languages (e.g., Python, Go, Zig)

Raylib uses OpenGL internally (or optionally DirectX, Metal, or Vulkan via backends), and supports drawing primitives, textures, cameras, 3D meshes, shaders, and audio.

## 🧩 Core Features

- 2D and 3D rendering support  
- Simple window/context creation  
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)  
- Audio playback and control  
- Built-in shaders and materials  
- Camera systems (2D and 3D)  
- Immediate-mode GUI via `raygui`  
- Minimal dependencies — no external windowing or graphics libraries required

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Visualization for reinforcement learning agents (e.g. [[PufferLib]])  
- Game development prototyping  
- Simulation rendering  
- Embedded visualization for robotics UIs  
- Learning OpenGL or graphics basics without large engines  
- GUI development with `raygui`
