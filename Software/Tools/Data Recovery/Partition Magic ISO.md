# Partition Magic ISO

Partition Magic was a disk partitioning utility originally developed by PowerQuest and later acquired by Symantec. It allowed users to create, resize, move, merge, and convert partitions without losing data. While discontinued in the mid-2000s, ISO images of Partition Magic bootable media are still found online and sometimes used for legacy systems. However, due to lack of updates and modern file system support, it has largely been replaced by free and open-source alternatives.

## 🧭 Overview

Partition Magic was popular for its ability to manage partitions without requiring a full reformat. Distributed as both a Windows installer and a bootable ISO, it provided a GUI-based interface that simplified partitioning tasks for non-expert users. Today, its ISO form is mostly relevant for recovery and retro-computing on older machines (e.g., Windows XP/2000).

## ⚙️ Core Concepts

- **Partition Resizing**: Adjust partition sizes without data loss (on supported systems).
- **Bootable ISO**: Allowed partition management outside of Windows, useful for system recovery.
- **File System Support**: Primarily FAT, FAT32, and early NTFS.
- **Merging/Conversion**: Merge partitions or convert FAT ↔ FAT32.

## 📂 Common Scenarios

- **Legacy System Recovery**: Managing partitions on Windows XP or older machines.
- **Boot Repair**: Adjusting partitions when dual-boot setups went wrong.
- **Resizing for Dual Boot**: Shrinking NTFS partitions to make space for Linux.
- **Data Preservation**: Non-destructive repartitioning (for FAT/early NTFS).

## 📝 Summary

Partition Magic ISO was once a standard tool for disk partitioning and recovery, offering ease of use for Windows users in the FAT/NTFS era. Today, its ISO images survive mostly for historical or legacy system use. Modern users should prefer actively maintained tools like [[GParted]], [[Parted]], or Windows-native partition managers, which support newer file systems and disk technologies.
