# USB Device Enumeration Failure – Detailed Analysis

## High-Level Overview

This log captures a sequence of USB-related kernel messages on a Linux system. The entries show a normal USB initialization sequence after boot, followed by repeated USB enumeration failures, and finally a successful detection of a different USB storage device.

At a high level, the key events are:

1. A **Western Digital My Passport** USB drive was initially detected successfully (`idVendor=1058, idProduct=2626`).
2. Later, the USB subsystem was **reset and reinitialized**, possibly due to a reboot or driver reload.
3. Multiple **USB devices failed to enumerate** correctly on certain ports, especially **port 2 of the USB 3.0 controller**.
4. The kernel repeatedly reported **errors `-11` and `-71`** during device descriptor reads and address assignments.
5. The system attempted multiple **power cycles** on the USB ports, implying persistent communication problems.
6. Eventually, a **different Western Digital drive** (`easystore 264D`) connected successfully via the USB 3.0 SuperSpeed controller.

These logs point to either:
- Faulty or unstable USB hardware (port, cable, or device)
- Electrical instability or insufficient power on a specific port
- Controller firmware or driver issues, particularly involving the `xhci_hcd` (USB 3.x) subsystem.

## Most Concerning Aspects

1. **Repeated Enumeration Failures with -11 and -71 Errors**  
   These indicate fundamental communication issues at the USB protocol level. The host cannot reliably exchange even the most basic device descriptors.

2. **“Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?” Messages**  
   This strongly suggests physical-layer problems — poor contact, shorted pins, or electrical noise on the USB line.

3. **Power Cycling Attempts**  
   The kernel tried multiple times to reset and power cycle the affected port, meaning the controller exhausted normal recovery paths.

4. **Frequent Context Errors (`invalid context state for evaluate context command`)**  
   These are low-level xHCI driver warnings that hint the controller was in an unexpected or undefined state — often following a hardware error.

5. **Eventual Success on Another Port**  
   When a different drive was plugged into another port (USB 4-5), it initialized normally. This rules out a total USB subsystem failure and isolates the issue to **specific ports or cables**.

## Detailed Line-by-Line Breakdown

### Initial Successful Connection (15:08)
- The kernel successfully detected and initialized the Western Digital **My Passport 2626** external drive on `usb 3-5`.
- The messages confirm normal USB enumeration:
  - Device identified (`idVendor=1058`)
  - Strings read successfully (manufacturer, product, serial)
  - Storage class driver loaded (`usb-storage`)
- Conclusion: The USB 3.x controller (`xhci_hcd`) and the device both functioned correctly at this point.

---

### USB Subsystem Reinitialization (19:29)
- The kernel re-registers core USB drivers: `usbcore`, `ehci-pci`, and `xhci_hcd`.
- This typically happens **after a reboot** or **kernel module reload**.
- The host controllers for USB 2.0 (`ehci-pci`) and USB 3.0 (`xhci_hcd`) are both set up again.
- The USB bus numbers are re-assigned, starting with 1–4.

---

### Enumeration Failures on EHCI Controllers
Lines such as:
- `usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -11`
- `usb usb1-port1: attempt power cycle`
- `usb usb1-port1: unable to enumerate USB device`

indicate repeated failures while attempting to identify a USB 2.0 device on ports controlled by `ehci-pci`.

#### Error -11: `EAGAIN` (Try Again)
- This means the host requested data (device descriptor) but received **no valid response** before timeout.
- Often seen when:
  - The USB device is not powered correctly
  - The signal integrity is poor (bad cable, port damage)
  - Firmware or hardware on the device is unresponsive

When multiple retries still fail, the kernel gives up and attempts a **power cycle** to reset the port.

---

### Switch to xHCI Controller (USB 3.0)
After the EHCI failures, the kernel loads `xhci_hcd` and registers buses 3 and 4:
- `xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: new USB bus registered`
- This is the USB 3.0 controller on your system’s Intel chipset.

Several devices are enumerated successfully.

This confirms that **the USB controller and driver are operational** in general — the issues are **port-specific**, not system-wide.

---

### Port 2 Enumeration Failures on USB 3.0
- The recurring message `usb usb3-port2: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?` appears several times.
- This port repeatedly fails to initialize a connected device.
- Each attempt to read the device descriptor fails with `error -71`.

#### Error -71: `EPROTO` (Protocol Error)
- Indicates a **USB protocol violation** — corrupted or invalid signaling between host and device.
- Usually caused by:
  - Electrical interference
  - Faulty USB cable or port
  - Device trying to operate at the wrong speed (e.g., SuperSpeed negotiation failure)
  - Host controller timing bug or firmware issue

Linux’s `xhci_hcd` driver treats this as a critical error and attempts to **power cycle** the port to reset the connection.

---

### "Device Not Responding to Setup Address"
This appears during the enumeration process:
- When a device connects, the host assigns it a temporary address before configuration.
- If the device doesn’t acknowledge setup packets, the host logs `Device not responding to setup address` and retries.
- Multiple failures in this step confirm that **communication never stabilizes**.

---

### “Invalid Context State for Evaluate Context Command”
This line:
- `usb 3-2: WARN: invalid context state for evaluate context command.`

comes from the `xhci_hcd` driver. It means:
- The driver tried to configure or re-evaluate a device slot (logical context for USB communication),
- But the controller reported that the context was in an invalid state, likely due to earlier enumeration failures.

This suggests the **controller itself became temporarily unstable**, which can happen after repeated errors on one port.

---

### Final Working Connection (19:31)
- A new device, **Western Digital easystore 264D**, is detected on `usb 4-5`.
- It enumerates perfectly, showing:
  - Manufacturer: Western Digital
  - Product: easystore 264D
  - Driver: `usb-storage`
- This confirms the **controller, drivers, and most ports are healthy**.
- The earlier failures are isolated to a single **physical port or cable**.

## Summary of Likely Causes

| Category | Possible Cause | Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Physical** | Faulty USB cable or port | “Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?” |
| **Electrical** | Insufficient power or EMI | Intermittent device descriptor read failures |
| **Controller Firmware** | xHCI context errors | “invalid context state” warnings |
| **Device-Specific** | Malfunctioning device firmware | Persistent `-71` protocol errors |
| **Systemic** | Unlikely (other devices worked fine) | Normal operation of other ports/devices |

---

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Avoid trusting the affected port** for any important device.  
   Hardware degradation or physical damage is likely.

2. **Test with a different cable and port**, especially on the back panel rather than the front headers.

3. **Inspect dmesg** after plugging a known-good device into the same port.  
   If errors persist, the motherboard port is suspect.

4. **Check power delivery** if using unpowered hubs or external drives.

5. **Consider BIOS/UEFI updates** for the USB controller firmware, especially on older Intel chipsets.

6. **Do not reconnect critical drives** until you verify stability — enumeration errors like `-71` can precede data corruption if the device flaps on and off mid-transfer.

---

## Conclusion

This sequence shows a **localized USB hardware or signaling failure**, manifesting as repeated enumeration errors (`-11`, `-71`), power cycling, and context state warnings. The rest of the system’s USB infrastructure works fine. The failing port should be treated as unreliable until verified with known-good hardware.
