# REST API

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized method for enabling communication between different software systems over HTTP. RESTful APIs are widely used in robotics, web applications, cloud services, and IoT for exposing sensor data, controlling actuators, or integrating external services.

---

## üìö Overview

REST APIs use stateless HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to access and manipulate resources identified by URLs. Each resource is represented as a distinct URI, and clients interact with these resources using standard operations. REST emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and the use of standard web protocols.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Resources**: Identified by URIs, such as `/robot/pose`
- **HTTP Verbs**:
  - `GET`: Retrieve data
  - `POST`: Create new resource
  - `PUT`: Update existing resource
  - `DELETE`: Remove resource
- **Statelessness**: Each request is independent with no stored session state
- **Representations**: Commonly JSON, sometimes XML or others
- **Headers**: Carry metadata (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`)
- **Status Codes**: Indicate success/failure (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robot status dashboards (e.g., `GET /status`)
- Remote command/control (e.g., `POST /move`)
- Logging and telemetry endpoints (e.g., `POST /sensor-data`)
- Integration with external cloud services (e.g., mapping, analytics)
- Triggering simulations or parameter updates from UI or CI/CD pipelines

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Widely supported and understood
- Easy to use from web clients, mobile, and CLI tools
- Human-readable (JSON), easy to debug
- Stateless nature improves scalability
- Language agnostic‚Äîusable from Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- No built-in bi-directional communication (unlike WebSockets or gRPC)
- Less efficient for large or frequent binary data (e.g., image streams)
- Verb-based protocol is more rigid than pub-sub or RPC systems
- Statelessness can be limiting in session-based robotics scenarios
