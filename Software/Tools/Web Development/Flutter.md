# ü¶ã Flutter

## üß≠ Overview

**Flutter** is an open-source UI toolkit and framework developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the **Dart** programming language and provides a rich set of pre-built widgets for fast, expressive, and flexible UI development.

Flutter is widely used for cross-platform app development, enabling developers to create high-performance apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the web.
