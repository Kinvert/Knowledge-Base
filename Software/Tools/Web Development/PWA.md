# PWA (Progressive Web App)

A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a type of web application that leverages modern web technologies to deliver a user experience similar to native mobile or desktop apps. PWAs combine the reach and simplicity of the web with features traditionally reserved for native platforms, such as offline access, background sync, and push notifications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

PWAs are designed to be **reliable, fast, and engaging**. They use a combination of **service workers**, **web app manifests**, and **responsive design** to function seamlessly across devices. Unlike traditional apps, they can be installed directly from the browser without going through app stores.

In the context of **drone swarms on farms**, a PWA could serve as a control dashboard, telemetry viewer, or farm-management platform accessible from any device with a web browser, even offline in the field.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Service Workers**: Scripts that enable offline caching, background updates, and push notifications.  
- **Web App Manifest**: A JSON file that provides metadata (name, icons, theme) and allows installation to the home screen.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app works across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.  
- **App-Like Experience**: Provides smooth navigation, minimal load times, and native-like interactions.  
- **Offline-First Approach**: Users can continue working even with poor or no connectivity.

| Feature / Approach         | PWA | Native App | Mobile Web App | Hybrid App (e.g., Ionic) | Desktop App |
|-----------------------------|-----|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Installation                | Browser-based | App store | No install | App store | Installer |
| Cross-Platform              | Yes | No (platform-specific) | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| Offline Support             | Yes (via caching) | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Performance                 | High (but below native) | Highest | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| Drone Swarm Use Case        | Farm dashboards, telemetry, control panels | High-performance flight apps | Quick info portals | Balanced apps | Heavy data analysis |
