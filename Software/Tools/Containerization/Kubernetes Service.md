# Kubernetes Service

A **Kubernetes Service** is an abstraction that defines a stable network endpoint to access a set of pods. Because pods are ephemeral and can change IP addresses, services provide a consistent method for inter-pod or external communication. In robotics, services enable reliable communication between modules such as mapping, control, and visualization‚Äîeven as components scale or restart.

---

## üìö Overview

Services group one or more pods using **labels** and expose them through a single DNS name or IP address. The service handles load balancing, optional port mapping, and cluster-wide accessibility. Kubernetes supports several service types, such as `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer`, depending on accessibility needs.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Selector**: Matches pods using labels to route traffic.
- **ClusterIP**: Default service type, accessible only within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes a service on a static port across all nodes.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes a service via cloud load balancer (cloud environments).
- **Headless Service**: Skips load balancing, often used with StatefulSets or DNS discovery.
- **Endpoints**: Tracks the real-time IPs of pods matched by the service selector.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Accessing a SLAM backend from a front-end UI in a pod
- Routing messages to perception or control subsystems
- Exposing simulation dashboards (e.g., RViz, Gazebo web interfaces)
- Communicating with external robotics hardware or APIs via NodePort
- Providing a stable name to discover multi-instance services (e.g., planners)

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Abstracts dynamic pod IPs behind a consistent address
- Supports internal and external load balancing
- Scales easily with pod replicas
- Integrates with DNS (`service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`)
- Works seamlessly with `kube-proxy` and other networking layers

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- NodePort exposes all nodes, may increase attack surface
- ClusterIP isn't accessible outside the cluster by default
- LoadBalancer requires cloud provider or MetalLB setup
- Cannot load balance based on content or headers (use Ingress instead)

| Service Type    | Accessible From       | Use Case                              | Notes                            |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ClusterIP        | Inside cluster only     | Internal microservices                 | Default, DNS-based               |
| NodePort         | External via node port  | Dev testing, simple external access    | Port range 30000-32767          |
| LoadBalancer     | Public IP (cloud)       | Production web services, APIs          | Requires cloud or MetalLB       |
| Headless         | Inside cluster (no IP)  | Stateful workloads, custom discovery   | Returns individual pod IPs      |

| Component         | Exposed As           | Example                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| SLAM Backend       | ClusterIP             | `/slam_server:8080` inside cluster       |
| Web-based RViz     | NodePort              | Accessed via `http://node-ip:31000`      |
| Control Module     | LoadBalancer (cloud)  | Used in simulation farms                 |
| Sensor Aggregator  | Headless              | Queried directly by stateful clients     |
