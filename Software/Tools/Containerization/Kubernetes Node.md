# Kubernetes Node

A **Kubernetes Node** is a physical or virtual machine in a Kubernetes cluster that runs the containerized workloads (pods). Each node is managed by the Kubernetes control plane and includes components like `kubelet`, `kube-proxy`, and a **container runtime**. In robotics, nodes can be powerful servers, embedded Jetson devices, or even remote edge computers hosting specific parts of the robot stack.

## üìö Overview

Nodes are the execution environment for all application containers in a Kubernetes cluster. A healthy node reports its status and resource availability (CPU, memory, etc.) to the control plane. When a workload is scheduled to the node, the `kubelet` ensures it runs properly. Nodes can be homogeneous or heterogeneous and support GPU, FPGA, or real-time OS extensions.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **kubelet**: Ensures containers are running and healthy.
- **kube-proxy**: Manages network routing rules for pod communication.
- **Container Runtime**: Runs containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O).
- **Pod Hosting**: Nodes host one or more pods, which are the smallest deployable units.
- **Labels/Taints**: Used to control scheduling behavior or designate special-purpose nodes.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Deploying vision pipelines to Jetson nodes near cameras
- Running SLAM or perception containers close to the robot‚Äôs sensors
- Hosting large simulations or ROS2 backends on desktop/server nodes
- Offloading AI inference to GPU-equipped nodes
- Isolating critical workloads using node selectors or affinities

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Supports heterogeneity (e.g., x86 + ARM nodes)
- Modular: failures are isolated to individual nodes
- Scalable: easily add/remove nodes from the cluster
- Granular resource tracking and reporting
- Edge-friendly for distributed robotics

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Failure of node can result in pod eviction or downtime
- Requires monitoring and log collection at node level
- Networking setup can vary across environments (cloud, local, edge)
- Performance varies based on container runtime and hardware
