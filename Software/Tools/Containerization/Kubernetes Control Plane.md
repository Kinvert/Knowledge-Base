# Kubernetes Control Plane

The Kubernetes Control Plane is the set of components that manages the overall state and behavior of a Kubernetes cluster. It makes global decisions about scheduling, scaling, and responding to cluster events. For robotics and distributed systems, understanding the control plane is essential when deploying services across edge devices, simulators, or cloud-hosted infrastructure.

---

## üìö Overview

The control plane exposes the Kubernetes API and orchestrates the lifecycle of all cluster resources. It continuously reconciles the desired state (defined in manifests) with the actual cluster state. It is usually run on dedicated nodes and interacts with the **worker nodes**, where workloads like ROS2 pods or simulations run.

---

## üß† Core Components

- **[[kube-apiserver]]**: The entry point to the cluster; handles REST API requests.
- **[[etcd]]**: Distributed key-value store for storing cluster state/configuration.
- **[[kube-scheduler]]**: Assigns pods to nodes based on constraints and resource usage.
- **[[kube-controller-manager]]**: Runs controllers to maintain cluster state (e.g., node health, job completion).
- **[[cloud-controller-manager]]**: Integrates cloud-specific logic (e.g., load balancers, storage provisioning).

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Managing multiple ROS2 workloads (mapping, navigation, object detection)
- Scheduling compute-intensive pods on GPU-capable nodes (e.g., Jetson or desktop)
- Auto-restarting failed pods in multi-robot systems
- Load-balancing inference services across simulation and real robot nodes
- Dynamically scaling nodes with robotic task load

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Decouples logic from execution (centralized orchestration)
- Ensures high availability and consistent state
- Supports self-healing and automated rollout/rollback
- Extensible via custom controllers or APIs
- Works across hybrid cloud/edge deployments

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Single point of failure if not highly available
- Complexity in debugging when things go wrong
- Latency between control plane and edge nodes can affect performance
- Requires TLS and RBAC setup for secure operation

## ü§ñ Comparison: Control Plane vs Worker Node

| Feature              | Control Plane               | Worker Node               |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Main Role**         | Management & orchestration   | Running workloads (pods)   |
| **Contains**          | API server, etcd, scheduler  | kubelet, container runtime |
| **ROS2 Usage**        | Schedules and monitors pods  | Runs ROS2 containers       |
| **Failure Impact**    | Cluster control lost         | Affects only that node     |
