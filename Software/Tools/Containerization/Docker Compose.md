# Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications using a declarative YAML configuration file. It simplifies the orchestration of complex setups by enabling services like ROS2 nodes, databases, visualizers, and simulators to be spun up with a single command. This is especially useful in robotics, where multiple tightly integrated components must run concurrently.

---

## üìö Overview

Compose uses a file called `docker-compose.yml` to define services, networks, and volumes. It provides a CLI (`docker compose up`) to start, stop, and manage the entire application stack. It is well-suited for local development, prototyping, integration testing, and edge deployments.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Service**: A container definition (image, ports, volumes, etc.)
- **Network**: A virtual network for communication between services
- **Volume**: Persistent or shared storage across containers
- **Depends_On**: Specifies service dependencies and startup order
- **Build**: Option to build an image directly from a local `Dockerfile`

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Launching a complete SLAM pipeline (e.g., sensor node, visualizer, backend)
- Running Gazebo + RViz + bridge nodes for simulation
- Defining ROS2 ecosystems for collaborative research
- Starting up diagnostics, monitoring, and control UIs alongside robot code
- Creating portable integration testing environments

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Simple orchestration for multi-container setups
- Single command to start/stop the whole system
- Services run in isolated but connected environments
- Supports volume mounts for live development
- Easily portable between machines and teams

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- No built-in scaling or cluster management (not suitable for large-scale deployments)
- Limited support for advanced networking or autoscaling
- Debugging startup order or failed services can be tricky
- Containers may become tightly coupled if overused
