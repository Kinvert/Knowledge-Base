# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it has become the industry standard for orchestrating workloads across clusters of machines. In robotics and engineering, Kubernetes enables cloud-native infrastructure for simulation, fleet management, edge deployment, and AI/ML pipelines.

---

## 📚 Overview

At its core, Kubernetes manages clusters of machines (nodes) and runs workloads (pods) defined by declarative YAML configurations. It abstracts infrastructure away from applications, automating restarts, scaling, load balancing, and self-healing. Kubernetes integrates with Docker (and other container runtimes) and excels in multi-node, multi-tenant environments.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **[[Kubernetes Pod]]**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes (usually wraps one or more containers).
- **[[Kubernetes Node]]**: A machine (virtual or physical) running Kubernetes-managed workloads.
- **[[Kubernetes Deployment]]**: A higher-level controller that manages the lifecycle of pods.
- **[[Kubernetes Service]]**: A stable network endpoint for accessing pods.
- **[[Kubernetes Ingress]]**: Routes external traffic into the cluster.
- **[[Kubernetes Namespace]]**: Logical isolation for resources within a cluster.
- **[[Kubernetes ConfigMap]] & [[Kubernetes Secret]]**: Ways to inject configuration or sensitive data into workloads.

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Orchestrating distributed robotics services across cloud and edge
- Managing simulation environments (e.g., parallel Gazebo instances)
- Scaling up/down AI inference backends (e.g., object detection, SLAM)
- Fleet control for autonomous systems
- Managing CI/CD pipelines that depend on reproducible containers

---

## ✅ Pros

- Industry-standard orchestration platform
- Supports autoscaling, rolling updates, fault tolerance
- Works across on-premise, edge, and cloud infrastructure
- Enables declarative, reproducible infrastructure as code
- Compatible with modern CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows

---

## ❌ Cons

- Steep learning curve, especially for non-cloud-native users
- High resource overhead for small embedded systems
- Complexity may be overkill for small-scale robotics projects
- Real-time performance requires tuning and careful planning
