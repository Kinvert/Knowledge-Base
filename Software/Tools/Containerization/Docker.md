# Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers. These containers can run reliably across different environments, making Docker an essential tool in modern robotics and engineering workflows, particularly for deployment, simulation, and CI/CD.

---

## 📚 Overview

Docker uses lightweight containerization to bundle software, libraries, configurations, and environments. In robotics, Docker simplifies reproducibility, multi-platform development, and cross-compilation—especially when working with complex stacks like ROS, computer vision, or simulation environments.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **[[Docker Image]]**: A snapshot of a container environment (OS + dependencies + app).
- **[[Docker Container]]**: A running instance of an image.
- **[[Dockerfile]]**: Script that defines how an image is built.
- **[[Docker Volumes]]**: Mounted file paths for persistent or shared data.
- **[[Docker Networks]]**: Virtualized networking between containers.
- **[[Docker Registry]]**: Repository for storing and sharing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Running ROS1/ROS2 without polluting the host system
- Building cross-platform ARM/AMD64 environments
- Creating reproducible CI test environments
- Isolating simulation tools like Gazebo or Webots
- Packaging web servers, ML models, or REST APIs for robotic systems

---

## ✅ Pros

- Environment consistency across machines
- Fast and lightweight compared to full VMs
- Easy version control for environments
- Works across cloud and edge devices
- Encourages modular system design

---

## ❌ Cons

- Learning curve for Dockerfiles and container management
- Requires root or special permissions for low-level hardware access
- GPU and USB access needs extra configuration
- Less performant than native execution in some edge cases
