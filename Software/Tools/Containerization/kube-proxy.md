# kube-proxy

`kube-proxy` is a network component of Kubernetes that runs on each node and maintains network rules to enable communication between services and pods. It manages virtual IPs (ClusterIPs), load balancing, and routing, making service discovery and pod-to-pod communication seamless‚Äîeven in complex, multi-host robotics deployments.

---

## üìö Overview

`kube-proxy` enables the Kubernetes **Service abstraction** by implementing network rules via `iptables`, `ipvs`, or user-space proxies. These rules allow traffic to be routed to the appropriate backend pods. For robotics systems using ROS2, simulation clusters, or sensor data processing graphs, `kube-proxy` ensures that distributed nodes can discover and talk to each other.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Service Discovery**: Routes traffic from a ClusterIP to available backend pods.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple pod instances of a service.
- **iptables/ipvs**: Implements forwarding rules using native Linux networking features.
- **Endpoints**: List of pod IPs backing a given service.
- **NodePort**: Exposes a service on a static port on each node for external access.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Enabling ROS2 services and nodes to talk over DDS across multiple pods
- Routing messages between sensor nodes and SLAM backends in separate pods
- Balancing simulation service traffic (e.g., Web UIs or loggers)
- Supporting multi-robot deployments in the same Kubernetes cluster
- Exposing data ingestion endpoints from robots to backend processing services

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Automates internal service discovery and routing
- Supports various backends: iptables, IPVS, user space
- Minimal configuration required for internal communication
- Works with all standard Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Latency overhead compared to direct pod-to-pod communication
- Not suitable for high-performance UDP by default
- Troubleshooting network issues requires deep knowledge of Linux networking
- Load balancing is session-unaware (may cause instability for long-lived ROS2 connections)
