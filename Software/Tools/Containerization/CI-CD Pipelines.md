# CI-CD Pipelines

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) Pipelines are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code. In robotics and engineering projects, CI/CD ensures that software is reliably integrated, containerized, and deployed to hardware, cloud, or simulation environments without manual intervention.

---

## üìö Overview

CI/CD pipelines consist of stages such as code checkout, dependency installation, build, testing, and deployment. These stages are executed automatically upon events like a `git push` or `pull request`, helping maintain software quality and reducing deployment friction.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically build and test code with each commit or merge.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery)**: Automatically prepare builds for deployment, often requiring manual approval.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Automatically deploy validated builds to production systems.
- **Pipeline Stages**: Steps like `build`, `test`, `lint`, `deploy`.
- **Artifacts**: Files (binaries, images, logs) produced by the pipeline for distribution or debugging.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Building and testing ROS2 nodes in Docker containers
- Running unit tests, integration tests, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests
- Auto-deploying robotics services to Kubernetes clusters or edge devices
- Linting and static analysis of C++, Python, or launch files
- Publishing Docker Images or binary firmware to registries

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Catch integration bugs early through automated testing
- Enforces code quality with static analysis and style checks
- Reproducible and auditable builds and deployments
- Saves engineering time and reduces deployment errors
- Encourages modular and testable system design

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Setup can be complex, especially for robotics-specific environments
- Build pipelines for simulations or hardware can be resource-intensive
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing requires physical test rigs or emulation
- Needs careful secret management and permission configuration
