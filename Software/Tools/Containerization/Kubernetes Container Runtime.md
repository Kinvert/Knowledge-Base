# Kubernetes Container Runtime

The **Kubernetes Container Runtime** is the low-level component responsible for running containers on each worker node. It serves as the bridge between the `kubelet` and the actual container execution engine, enabling Kubernetes to launch, monitor, and manage containers. In robotics, this layer ensures that ROS2 nodes, perception modules, or simulators are reliably executed on a variety of hardware platforms.

---

## 📚 Overview

Kubernetes does **not** run containers directly. Instead, it uses a **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** that abstracts away the underlying runtime. Popular runtimes like **containerd**, **CRI-O**, and formerly **Docker** implement the CRI to allow Kubernetes to manage containers in a standardized way.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **[[CRI]] (Container Runtime Interface)**: A gRPC-based API standard that Kubernetes uses to talk to runtimes.
- **[[containerd]]**: The default runtime in most modern Kubernetes setups.
- **[[CRI-O]]**: A lightweight runtime purpose-built for Kubernetes.
- **[[Docker Shim]]**: Legacy bridge used to connect Docker to Kubernetes (deprecated in Kubernetes v1.24+).
- **[[RuntimeClass]]**: Kubernetes abstraction for selecting different runtimes per workload.

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Running lightweight containers on embedded/edge robotics nodes (e.g., Jetson)
- Executing compute-intensive perception stacks with GPU support
- Separating real-time containers (e.g., navigation) from general workloads
- Testing compatibility of robotic workloads across container runtimes
- Deploying simulation environments alongside live containers

---

## ✅ Pros

- Clean separation of container execution from Kubernetes logic
- Allows swapping runtimes depending on use case (e.g., real-time, GPU)
- Enhances flexibility and portability of robotic applications
- Supports namespaces, cgroups, seccomp, and other isolation tools

---

## ❌ Cons

- Misconfigured runtimes can lead to container failures
- Advanced features (e.g., GPU support) require tuning per runtime
- Docker users may face confusion after shim deprecation
- Requires familiarity with runtime-specific configuration files and tooling
