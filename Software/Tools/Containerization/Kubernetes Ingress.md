# Kubernetes Ingress

A **Kubernetes Ingress** is an API object that manages external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides fine-grained routing rules, SSL termination, and load balancing, enabling seamless and secure exposure of multiple services through a single external IP or hostname.

---

## üìö Overview

Ingress acts as a smart gateway for external users or systems to reach internal Kubernetes services. Unlike Services (which provide cluster-internal routing or simple external exposure via NodePort/LoadBalancer), Ingress supports advanced traffic control such as path-based routing, virtual hosts, and TLS termination. This is particularly useful in robotics deployments with web dashboards, REST APIs, or multi-service microservices architectures.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Ingress Resource**: Declarative routing rules (host, path, TLS).
- **Ingress Controller**: The implementation that watches Ingress resources and configures the underlying proxy (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy).
- **TLS Termination**: Offloads SSL encryption/decryption at the ingress.
- **Path-based Routing**: Routes requests based on URL paths.
- **Host-based Routing**: Routes requests based on hostname or domain.
- **Backend Services**: Target Kubernetes Services that receive traffic.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Expose multiple robotics microservices through a single external IP.
- Secure web-based monitoring dashboards (e.g., RViz web, simulation GUIs).
- Enable HTTPS with automatic certificate provisioning (e.g., via cert-manager).
- Route traffic for different robot fleets or environments via hostnames or paths.
- Implement blue-green or canary deployments by controlling traffic split.

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Centralizes external access management.
- Enables HTTPS/TLS with easy certificate management.
- Supports complex routing (paths, hosts).
- Reduces need for multiple LoadBalancer IPs.
- Integrates with cloud provider or custom ingress controllers.

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Requires deployment and management of an ingress controller.
- Can add latency and complexity in traffic flow.
- Configuration syntax can be complex for advanced rules.
- Not suitable for non-HTTP protocols without specialized controllers.
