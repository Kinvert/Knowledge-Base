# Snap

**Snap** is a universal Linux package format and package manager developed by Canonical, designed to work across multiple Linux distributions. Snap packages (called “snaps”) bundle an application and its dependencies into a single, sandboxed, and self-contained package, making installation and updates consistent and simple.

---

## 📚 Overview

Snap aims to solve issues of dependency conflicts and environment inconsistencies by packaging everything an application needs into one compressed file. It supports automatic updates and rollback features. Snap is widely used for delivering robotics tools, GUI apps, and services on Ubuntu and other Linux distros.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Snap Package**: Self-contained app bundle with dependencies
- **Snapd**: Background service managing snap lifecycle (install, update, remove)
- **Channels**: Release tracks (stable, candidate, beta, edge) for update control
- **Sandboxing**: Snaps run confined with controlled access to system resources
- **Stores**: Centralized repository (Snap Store) for publishing and distributing snaps

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Installing robotics GUI tools like Foxglove Studio or QGroundControl
- Deploying simulation environments with all dependencies included
- Delivering development tools across different Linux distros without conflicts
- Simplifying updates with automatic background refreshes
- Running containerized or isolated robotics services safely

---

## ✅ Pros

- Distribution-agnostic: Works on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, and more
- Handles dependencies internally, avoiding “dependency hell”
- Automatic updates with rollback support
- Sandboxed environment increases security and stability
- Easy installation and removal via simple CLI commands

---

## ❌ Cons

- Snap packages are generally larger than traditional packages
- Performance overhead due to sandboxing and confinement
- Some hardware or system integrations can be limited by confinement
- Not always the preferred package format in non-Ubuntu distros
- Slower startup times for some snaps
