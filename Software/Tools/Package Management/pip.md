# pip

**pip** is the default package manager for Python, used to install and manage packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories. In robotics, AI/ML, and embedded engineering, pip is a key tool for managing Python-based tools, libraries, and frameworks.

---

## 📚 Overview

pip installs Python packages and their dependencies directly into the active Python environment (system, `virtualenv`, `venv`, or `conda`). It plays a critical role in Python-based workflows, enabling rapid installation of packages like NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and ROS tools like `rosdep` or `catkin-tools`.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Package Index**: pip defaults to installing from PyPI but can use custom indexes
- **Requirements File**: Text file (`requirements.txt`) listing dependencies for reproducibility
- **Virtual Environments**: Often used with `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda` to isolate packages
- **Editable Installs**: Use `pip install -e .` during development
- **Wheel Files (.whl)**: Binary distributions for fast installation

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Install Python libraries for ROS2 nodes and tools
- Manage dependencies for robotics ML models
- Use in CI/CD pipelines for Python-based robotics services
- Package and distribute your own Python tools
- Integrate with Docker or Conda environments

---

## ✅ Pros

- Widely supported and standard in Python ecosystem
- Supports simple and complex dependency trees
- Integrates with virtual environments and containers
- Lightweight and fast for small packages
- Rich ecosystem: supports install from PyPI, Git, local paths

---

## ❌ Cons

- Python-only: can't manage C/C++/R dependencies (unlike Conda)
- Dependency resolution can fail or cause conflicts
- No native environment isolation
- Some large packages are slow to install if no wheel available

|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ROS2 tool development (Python nodes) | Install tools like `rclpy`, `rosdep`             |
| CV/ML with OpenCV or scikit-learn    | Install specific versions for testing            |
| Packaging robotics utilities         | `setup.py` and `pip install .` for distribution  |
| Reproducible builds                  | Use `requirements.txt` in CI pipelines           |
| Dockerized microservices             | pip installs during `Dockerfile` builds          |

- `pip install opencv-python` – Install a package  
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` – Install from a requirements file  
- `pip freeze > requirements.txt` – Export current dependencies  
- `pip uninstall numpy` – Remove a package  
- `pip list` – List installed packages  
- `pip install -e .` – Editable install (useful during development)
