# Helm

**Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. Helm uses “charts” — pre-configured Kubernetes resource templates — to deploy, upgrade, and version applications in a repeatable and manageable way.

---

## 📚 Overview

Helm streamlines Kubernetes application management by packaging all necessary resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) into charts. It supports templating, versioning, rollbacks, and dependency management, making complex Kubernetes deployments accessible and maintainable. In robotics, Helm can be used to deploy cloud-native robotics middleware, simulation platforms, or orchestration layers.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Chart**: A packaged collection of Kubernetes manifests and templates
- **Release**: An instance of a chart deployed to a Kubernetes cluster
- **Repository**: Remote storage of charts (e.g., Helm Hub, private repos)
- **Values**: Configuration data supplied to templates at install/upgrade
- **Templating Engine**: Uses Go templates to customize resource definitions dynamically

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Deploying ROS2 middleware and microservices in Kubernetes clusters
- Managing cloud simulators or visualization platforms like Foxglove
- Automating updates and rollbacks of robotics platform components
- Configuring multi-tenant robotics platforms with different parameters
- Sharing reusable Kubernetes application blueprints across teams

---

## ✅ Pros

- Simplifies complex Kubernetes deployments with templating
- Supports version control and easy rollbacks of releases
- Handles dependencies between charts
- Large ecosystem of community and official charts
- Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments

---

## ❌ Cons

- Learning curve for Helm templating language and Kubernetes concepts
- Debugging templated manifests can be challenging
- Overhead for very simple deployments
- Chart maintenance can become complex for large projects
