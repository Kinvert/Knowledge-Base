# Conan

**Conan** is a decentralized, open-source C/C++ package manager that simplifies dependency management in complex C++ projects. It helps developers download, configure, and build libraries across different platforms and compilers—a critical capability in robotics and embedded systems, where toolchains and environments vary widely.

---

## 📚 Overview

Conan handles external libraries like Boost, OpenCV, Eigen, and many robotics-related dependencies. It integrates well with popular build systems like **CMake**, **Meson**, and **Make**, and supports binary caching and reproducible builds. With Conan, teams can version, share, and reuse dependencies in both embedded and cloud-native environments.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Conanfile.py** or **conanfile.txt**: Declares dependencies and build requirements
- **Conan Center**: Central repository for thousands of C++ packages
- **Remotes**: Package sources (e.g., Artifactory, private repos)
- **Profiles**: Define compiler, architecture, and build options
- **Binary Packages**: Built artifacts stored in a remote or local cache

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Manage dependencies in C++ robotics middleware and tools
- Share libraries between teams across ROS or embedded projects
- Ensure consistent toolchains across machines or CI systems
- Avoid source-vs-binary mismatches in cross-compilation
- Simplify version pinning and upgrades of third-party libraries

---

## ✅ Pros

- Native support for C/C++ and build system integration
- Platform-agnostic: Linux, Windows, macOS, cross-compilation
- Fine-grained control over build flags, compiler versions, etc.
- Supports both public and private package hosting
- Works well with CI/CD systems and Docker

---

## ❌ Cons

- Learning curve for `conanfile.py` and profiles
- Less mature ecosystem compared to pip or npm
- Package availability can be hit or miss for bleeding-edge libs
- Ties you into the Conan build model unless carefully managed
