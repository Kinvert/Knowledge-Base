# Package Managers

**Package Managers** are tools used to automate the installation, upgrade, configuration, and removal of software packages. They are essential in managing dependencies and ensuring reproducible environments in robotics, embedded systems, cloud computing, AI/ML, and more. Different ecosystems—such as programming languages, operating systems, and container orchestration—use specialized package managers.

---

## 📚 Overview

Package managers simplify the process of handling third-party libraries, system dependencies, and tooling for engineers and developers. They allow consistent builds, dependency resolution, and version control. In robotics, where stacks often span multiple languages and platforms, understanding various package managers is crucial for building, deploying, and maintaining complex systems.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Repositories**: Centralized or distributed servers where packages are stored.
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically identifies and installs required libraries.
- **Versioning**: Allows installation of specific versions of software.
- **Lock Files**: Capture exact versions to ensure deterministic builds.
- **Build Systems Integration**: Often tied to the build or deployment tools in a given ecosystem.
