# npm

**npm** (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment **Node.js**. It manages JavaScript packages and dependencies, making it a key tool in modern web development, frontend frameworks, backend APIs, and increasingly in cross-platform tools for robotics dashboards and control panels.

---

## 📚 Overview

npm installs and manages packages from the npm registry, which hosts over a million packages. It supports version control, semantic versioning, script automation, and dependency trees. In robotics and engineering contexts, npm is often used for front-end visualization tools (e.g., dashboards, Foxglove Studio plugins) and back-end servers (e.g., gRPC-Web or REST APIs).

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts
- **Scripts**: Task automation (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm test`)
- **Semantic Versioning**: Uses `^`, `~`, etc., to manage version ranges
- **Global vs Local Installs**: Install tools for system-wide (`-g`) or per-project use
- **node_modules**: Auto-managed folder storing all project dependencies

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Robotics dashboards (e.g., Node.js + React for monitoring)
- Building and serving front-end tools for [[ROS2 Web Bridge]]
- Managing build tools and static asset compilers (Webpack, Rollup, Vite)
- Hosting REST/gRPC backend services with Express or Fastify
- Controlling UI interfaces for physical simulators or control apps

---

## ✅ Pros

- Huge ecosystem and active community
- Easy to automate tasks and builds
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Seamless integration with front-end and back-end tooling
- Efficient module caching and installation

---

## ❌ Cons

- `node_modules` can become bloated or hard to manage
- Version conflicts due to deep nested dependencies
- Security issues with poorly maintained packages
- Not well-suited for low-level or embedded development
