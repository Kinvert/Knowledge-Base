# 🖌️ Blender: 3D Creation Suite

## 🧭 Overview

**Blender** is a free and open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entire 3D pipeline, including modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, and video editing. It is widely used in industries such as game development, film production, and 3D printing.

Blender is known for its versatility, active community, and extensive library of plugins and add-ons.
