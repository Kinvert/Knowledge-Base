# Jenkins

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy software. It is a widely adopted tool in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines and is known for its flexibility, plugin ecosystem, and ability to integrate with nearly any system. Jenkins is often used in robotics and engineering workflows to automate testing, container builds, and deployments for projects like ROS2 packages or embedded firmware.

---

## 📚 Overview

Jenkins provides a web interface and runs on Java. It allows users to create **pipelines** for automating complex workflows. Jobs can be configured through the GUI or via code using **Jenkinsfiles**, which define pipeline stages (e.g., build, test, deploy) in a declarative format.

It supports a vast library of plugins for integrating with GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Slack, and many other tools.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Job**: A unit of work such as a build or test
- **Pipeline**: A sequence of stages defined in a `Jenkinsfile`
- **Node/Agent**: A machine that runs Jenkins jobs (can be local or remote)
- **Executor**: A slot on a node that runs one job at a time
- **Plugin**: Extends Jenkins functionality (e.g., Docker plugin, Git plugin)
- **Declarative vs Scripted Pipeline**: Two syntax styles for defining jobs

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- CI/CD for robotics projects (e.g., ROS2, PX4, OpenCV)
- Building and testing Docker containers
- Running simulations as part of test suites
- Deploying to Kubernetes or embedded targets
- Monitoring hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests
- Scheduling nightly or regression builds
- Automated firmware builds for microcontrollers

---

## ✅ Pros

- Extremely flexible and customizable
- Vast plugin ecosystem
- Integrates with almost any system or protocol
- Supports both GUI-driven and code-driven pipelines
- Good choice for private or air-gapped infrastructure

---

## ❌ Cons

- Can be complex and heavy to set up and maintain
- UI can be unintuitive compared to modern alternatives
- Plugins may be outdated or poorly maintained
- Scaling Jenkins is more difficult than cloud-native CI tools
- Less seamless GitHub integration compared to GitHub Actions

## 🤖 In a Robotics Context

| Task                               | Jenkins Application                            |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Build and test ROS2 packages       | Use Docker + Jenkinsfile to build colcon stacks |
| Run simulation tests               | Trigger Gazebo tests via CI                    |
| Deploy container to K8s            | Use `kubectl` or `helm` in Jenkins pipeline     |
| Firmware cross-compilation         | Run on agent with arm-none-eabi toolchain       |
| Validate SLAM outputs              | Compare map data post-run using custom scripts  |
