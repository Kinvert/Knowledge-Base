## tcptrace

**tcptrace** is a free and open-source tool designed for analyzing TCP dump files, primarily to assist in network troubleshooting and performance analysis. It was developed by Shawn Ostermann at Ohio University and works with packet capture files produced by tools like `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, and `snoop`[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcptrace)[3](https://www.tcptrace.org/)[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/).

## Features

- Analyzes TCP and (minimally) UDP sessions from packet capture files[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcptrace)[2](https://wiki.geant.org/display/EK/TcpTrace).
    
- Provides detailed statistics for each connection, including:
    
    - Elapsed time
        
    - Bytes and segments sent/received
        
    - Retransmissions
        
    - Round-trip times (RTT)
        
    - Window advertisements
        
    - Throughput[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcptrace)[3](https://www.tcptrace.org/)[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)
        
- Supports graphical output for further analysis (e.g., time-sequence graphs, throughput graphs)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcptrace)[3](https://www.tcptrace.org/)[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/).
    
- Can generate output compatible with the `xplot` tool for advanced visualization[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/).
    
- Useful for diagnosing TCP performance and reliability problems[8](https://prefetch.net/blog/2006/04/17/debugging-tcp-connections-with-tcptrace/).
    

## Typical Workflow

1. **Capture Packets**  
    Use `tcpdump` or a similar tool to capture network traffic:
    
```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.out
```
    
2. **Analyze with tcptrace**  
    Run tcptrace on the capture file:
    
```bash
tcptrace capture.out
```
    
    Or generate detailed output and graphs:
    
```bash
tcptrace -lW capture.out tcptrace -G capture.out
````
    
   - `-l`: Long output (detailed stats)
   - `-W`: Congestion window info
   - `-G`: Generate all graphs[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)

## Example Output

tcptrace provides a summary for each connection, including:

- Source and destination addresses/ports
    
- Connection label
    
- Number of packets and bytes transferred
    
- Retransmissions and other TCP events[5](https://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/2012/08/tcptrace-an-introduction/)[6](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/tcptrace.1.html)[8](https://prefetch.net/blog/2006/04/17/debugging-tcp-connections-with-tcptrace/)
    

## Graph Types

|Graph Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Time Sequence Graph|Plots sequence numbers over time, showing retransmissions and losses[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)[4](https://packetbomb.com/understanding-the-tcptrace-time-sequence-graph-in-wireshark/)|
|Throughput Graph|Visualizes throughput over time[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)|
|RTT Graph|Displays round-trip times[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)|
|Outstanding Data Graph|Shows data in flight (unacknowledged)[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)|
|Segment Size Graph|Plots segment sizes[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)|
|Time-Line Graph|Timeline of events in the connection[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)|

## Example Commands

```bash
# Basic session summary
tcptrace trace.log

# Detailed info for sessions 3 and 4
tcptrace -o3-4 -lrW trace.log

# Generate all graphs for analysis
tcptrace -G trace.log
```

## Use Cases

- Visualizing TCP flow behavior and identifying retransmissions, losses, or windowing issues[4](https://packetbomb.com/understanding-the-tcptrace-time-sequence-graph-in-wireshark/)[10](https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/tcpdumptcptrace-new/)
    
- Analyzing the impact of network changes or congestion control mechanisms
