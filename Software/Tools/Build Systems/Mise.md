# Mise

Mise is a modern developer tool that acts as a task runner, environment manager, and build automation system. It is often compared to tools like `make`, `poetry`, or `asdf`, but aims to unify multiple workflows into a single, streamlined command-line interface. For engineers in robotics, it can simplify managing dependencies, running builds, and ensuring reproducible development environments.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

Mise provides a centralized way to define tasks, scripts, and dependencies. Instead of juggling multiple tools for package management, virtual environments, and task execution, Mise allows developers to keep everything in a single configuration file.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Environment Management**: Handles multiple programming environments (Python, Node.js, etc.) without requiring system-wide installs.
- **Task Runner**: Lets you define repeatable commands in a `mise.toml` file.
- **Build Automation**: Can replace traditional tools like `make` for automating build steps.
- **Dependency Management**: Works with language-specific package managers but integrates them into a unified workflow.

## 🏆 Summary

Mise is a flexible, modern tool that bridges the gap between environment managers, task runners, and build systems. While it may not yet have the maturity or adoption of `make` or `CMake`, it provides an elegant solution for engineers who need a unified workflow across multiple languages and platforms. For robotics developers, it is particularly useful when managing projects that span Python, C++, and simulation tooling.
