# üñºÔ∏è CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)

CVAT is an open-source annotation tool for labeling data used in computer vision applications. It was originally developed by Intel and is now maintained by the open-source community under the Apache 2.0 license.

---

## üîé Summary

- **Full Name**: Computer Vision Annotation Tool
- **Type**: Open Source Data Annotation Platform
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Main Use Case**: Labeling images, videos, and 3D data for supervised machine learning models.

CVAT is one of the most powerful self-hosted data labeling tools, particularly well-suited for computer vision tasks. It supports a wide variety of annotation types, integrates well with machine learning workflows, and has become a de facto standard in many industries and research projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Annotation Types

| Annotation Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| [[Image Classification]] | Assign single or multiple class labels to entire images. |
| [[Object Detection]] | Draw bounding boxes around objects. |
| [[Semantic Segmentation]] | Pixel-wise class labels. |
| Instance Segmentation | Pixel-wise labels for each object instance. |
| Polygon Annotation | Freehand or point-to-point region marking. |
| Polyline Annotation | Useful for lanes, boundaries, etc. |
| Keypoint Annotation | Landmark detection (e.g., facial landmarks, pose estimation). |
| 3D Point Cloud Annotation | Annotate LIDAR or depth sensor data. |
| Video Annotation | Supports frame-by-frame object tracking. |
