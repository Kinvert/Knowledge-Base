# üè∑Ô∏è Data Labeling

**Data Labeling** is the process of annotating data to make it usable for supervised machine learning algorithms. Correctly labeled data allows models to learn patterns and make accurate predictions. Labeling is often one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive parts of building AI systems.

## üîé Summary

- **Purpose**: Annotating raw data with labels to provide ground truth for machine learning.
- **Data Types**: Images, video, audio, text, point clouds, time-series.
- **Applications**: Computer vision, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, speech recognition, healthcare, robotics, industrial inspection, and many more.

## üßÆ Types of Labeling

| Label Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Classification | Assigning a category | Cat vs. dog images |
| Object Detection | Bounding boxes around objects | Pedestrian detection in self-driving cars |
| Segmentation | Pixel-level labeling | Tumor detection in medical imaging |
| Keypoint Annotation | Specific landmarks | Facial recognition, human pose estimation |
| Audio Labeling | Time-coded transcription or tagging | Speech recognition, speaker identification |
| Text Annotation | Entity tagging, sentiment, parsing | Named entity recognition (NER), chatbots |
| Time-Series Labeling | Anomaly tagging, event detection | Industrial monitoring, predictive maintenance |
| 3D Point Cloud Labeling | LIDAR, radar annotation | Autonomous vehicles, robotics |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Challenges

- Requires domain expertise.
- Labeling can be expensive and time-consuming.
- Subjective or ambiguous cases.
- Maintaining label consistency across large teams.
- Quality assurance and validation.
- Privacy and security concerns (especially medical, personal data).
