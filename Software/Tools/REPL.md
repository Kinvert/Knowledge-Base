# REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

REPL is an interactive programming environment that takes single user inputs (expressions or commands), evaluates them, and returns the result immediately. It is widely used in interpreted languages and embedded systems to enable rapid prototyping, debugging, and live coding.

---

## üß† Overview

The REPL concept provides an immediate feedback loop, allowing developers to write code snippets, test functions, and interact with hardware or software dynamically. It is essential for embedded development environments like MicroPython, CircuitPython, and others where quick iterative testing is beneficial.

---

## üß∞ Key Features

- Interactive command-line interface for live code execution
- Immediate evaluation and output display
- Supports variables, expressions, and function calls
- Often accessible over serial, USB, or network interfaces
- Can include multiline input and history support
- Commonly paired with scripting languages and embedded interpreters
