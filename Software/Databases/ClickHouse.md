# ClickHouse

ClickHouse is an open-source, column-oriented database management system (DBMS) designed for high-performance online analytical processing (OLAP). It’s known for enabling real-time query execution on large-scale data sets, often billions of rows, with exceptional efficiency and low latency. While originally developed by Yandex, it has grown into a major player in the analytics and time-series ecosystem, often used in telemetry, robotics, and logging pipelines.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

ClickHouse stores data in columns rather than rows, allowing queries that aggregate data (like sums or averages) to scan only the required columns, reducing I/O and improving cache efficiency. This makes it particularly suited for analytics workloads rather than transaction-heavy use cases.

It supports SQL-like syntax, distributed processing, and parallel query execution across multiple nodes, providing both scalability and fault tolerance.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Columnar Storage**: Data is stored by columns, improving performance for aggregation queries.
- **Vectorized Execution**: Operates on blocks of data instead of row-by-row, reducing CPU overhead.
- **Compression**: Built-in codecs such as LZ4 and ZSTD reduce disk usage.
- **Materialized Views**: Allows pre-computed query results to speed up analytics.
- **MergeTree Engine**: A powerful table engine supporting partitioning, indexing, and data versioning.
- **Distributed Queries**: Data sharding and replication for scaling horizontally.
- **SQL Compatibility**: Standard SQL with ClickHouse-specific extensions for performance tuning.
- **Asynchronous Inserts**: Batched data ingestion ideal for high-throughput telemetry systems.

## 🔩 Use Cases

- **Robotics Telemetry**: Storing and querying sensor logs, actuator data, and mission analytics.
- **Performance Analytics**: Benchmarking robot control loops or motion planning algorithms.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Aggregating data from [[Prometheus]] or similar monitoring tools.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Serving feature data or analyzing offline training statistics.
- **Event Logging**: Handling large-scale, append-only logs for audit and debugging purposes.

## 🏆 Strengths

- Extremely fast aggregation and filtering on large data volumes.
- Scales horizontally across clusters with replication and sharding.
- Efficient compression and vectorized execution model.
- Supports complex analytical SQL queries.
- Excellent for real-time dashboards and metrics (e.g., [[Grafana]]).
- Low storage cost due to columnar compression.

---

## ⚠️ Weaknesses

- Not optimized for transactional workloads (OLTP).
- Limited support for updates/deletes; data is typically immutable.
- Steeper learning curve for tuning distributed setups.
- Less suitable for small, high-frequency write workloads compared to row-oriented databases.
