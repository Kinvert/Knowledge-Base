# OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** refers to a class of database systems and operations designed for **fast, complex analytical queries** on large amounts of data.  
Unlike OLTP systems (Online Transaction Processing), which handle frequent small transactions, OLAP systems are optimized for **aggregations, trends, and multidimensional analysis** ‚Äî such as analyzing telemetry, sensor logs, or operational metrics in robotics.

---

## üß† Overview

OLAP systems store data in a way that makes **summarization and aggregation efficient**, enabling engineers to analyze performance metrics or logs across time, dimensions, and categories.  
They‚Äôre often used in business intelligence (BI), telemetry analysis, and robotics data processing (e.g., evaluating thousands of robot runs).

OLAP systems can be **ROLAP (Relational)**, **MOLAP (Multidimensional)**, or **HOLAP (Hybrid)** depending on how data is stored and queried.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

- **Fact Table**: Core measurable data (e.g., robot events, trades, sensor readings)  
- **Dimension Tables**: Categorical data describing facts (e.g., robot type, environment, region)  
- **Cube / Multidimensional Model**: Data structured along multiple axes (time, location, robot model, etc.)  
- **Aggregation**: Precomputed summaries (SUM, AVG, COUNT)  
- **Drill-down / Roll-up**: Moving between levels of granularity  
- **Slice / Dice**: Filtering or reorienting data across dimensions  

---

## üìà Example Use Case

An analytics engineer might query:
`SELECT robot_model, avg(runtime) FROM robot_logs GROUP BY robot_model`

This type of query runs **much faster** on an OLAP database like [[ClickHouse]] or [[TimescaleDB]] than on a traditional OLTP database such as [[PostgreSQL]].

## üìä Comparison Chart

| Feature | OLAP | OLTP |
|----------|------|------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Analytical queries | Transaction processing |
| **Query Type** | Complex, aggregated | Simple, frequent |
| **Data Volume** | Large, historical | Small, real-time |
| **Schema** | Star / Snowflake | Normalized |
| **Write Speed** | Slower (batch) | Very fast (row-based) |
| **Read Speed** | Extremely fast (columnar) | Moderate |
| **Use Case** | Reporting, telemetry, trends | Orders, sessions, CRUD |
| **Example Systems** | [[ClickHouse]], [[Druid]], [[BigQuery]], [[Snowflake]] | [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], [[MongoDB]] |

## üîç OLAP Types

| Type | Description | Example Systems |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **ROLAP** | Uses relational databases to emulate OLAP behavior | [[PostgreSQL]] + [[Citus]] |
| **MOLAP** | Multidimensional cubes (pre-aggregated data) | Microsoft Analysis Services |
| **HOLAP** | Hybrid approach combining ROLAP + MOLAP | IBM Cognos TM1 |
| **Columnar OLAP** | Modern systems optimized for analytics | [[ClickHouse]], [[Apache Druid]], [[DuckDB]] |

## üßÆ How OLAP Works

OLAP engines typically:
1. Store data in **columnar format** for high compression and fast scans.  
2. Use **vectorized execution** and **SIMD** operations to process billions of rows efficiently.  
3. Support **materialized views** and **aggregating engines** for precomputed metrics.  
4. Optimize for **read-heavy** analytical workloads.  
5. Provide **parallel query execution** across CPUs or distributed clusters.

## ‚ö° Typical OLAP Operations

| Operation | Description | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Roll-up** | Aggregate data to a higher level | Hourly ‚Üí Daily totals |
| **Drill-down** | Show more detail | Daily ‚Üí Hourly trends |
| **Slice** | Filter by one dimension | Region = ‚ÄúUS‚Äù |
| **Dice** | Filter by multiple dimensions | Region = ‚ÄúUS‚Äù AND RobotType = ‚ÄúA1‚Äù |
| **Pivot** | Rotate dimensions for a new perspective | Time across columns |

## ü§ñ Use Cases in Robotics and Engineering

- Aggregating **sensor logs** across thousands of runs  
- Analyzing **fleet performance** metrics over time  
- Investigating **failure rate trends** by robot model or software version  
- Performing **multi-dimensional telemetry analysis** (location √ó time √ó hardware config)  
- Tracking **energy consumption patterns** and efficiency improvements  

---

## üß± OLAP Schema Examples

- **Star Schema**: One fact table linked to multiple dimensions  
- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimension tables for efficiency  
- **Flat Schema**: Denormalized table for speed (common in columnar OLAP)

**Example**  
Fact Table: `robot_metrics`  
Dimensions: `robot_model`, `location`, `date`  

Query: `SELECT robot_model, avg(cpu_usage) FROM robot_metrics GROUP BY robot_model`

---

## üß® Caution

‚ö†Ô∏è **OLAP systems are not for transactional writes.**
- Avoid using them for frequent row-level updates.  
- Inserts should be **batched** rather than per-event.  
- Schema changes can be heavy ‚Äî plan carefully.  
- Always verify `DROP`, `ALTER`, or `TRUNCATE` commands before executing; OLAP databases often lack undo mechanisms.  
- Prefer **replication** or **backups** before major schema adjustments.
