# Node.js

**Node.js** is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 engine. It enables running JavaScript code outside the browser, primarily for building scalable, event-driven server-side applications. Node.js is widely used for backend services, web APIs, and real-time applications.

---

## üìö Overview

Originally designed to enable JavaScript on the server, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and lightweight for data-intensive real-time applications. Its vast package ecosystem (`npm`) and asynchronous programming model have made it popular beyond web development, including in robotics for control interfaces, visualization dashboards, and communication layers.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Event Loop**: Handles asynchronous I/O operations without blocking the main thread  
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Enables high concurrency and scalability  
- **Single-threaded**: Uses a single thread with asynchronous callbacks or promises  
- **Modules**: Reusable code units managed with `require()` or ES modules (`import`)  
- **npm**: Node.js package manager and ecosystem with over a million packages

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Backend APIs for robotics control and telemetry  
- Real-time dashboards and web interfaces (e.g., for robot monitoring)  
- Communication bridges between hardware and web clients  
- Lightweight microservices in robotic software architectures  
- Prototyping and scripting with JavaScript outside the browser  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Fast, lightweight, and highly scalable  
- Huge ecosystem of open-source libraries via npm  
- Easy integration with web technologies (HTTP, WebSocket)  
- Supports asynchronous programming for efficient I/O  
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Single-threaded model may require extra work for CPU-intensive tasks  
- Callback-heavy code can become complex without Promises/async-await  
- Ecosystem can be fragmented with varying package quality  
- Less suited for real-time hard deadlines or embedded low-level control
