# C Memory Layout

The **C Memory Layout** defines how variables, functions, and data structures are organized in memory at runtime.  
Understanding it is crucial for debugging, optimizing performance, writing embedded or real-time systems, and ensuring interoperability through [[C ABI]] and [[C FFI]].  
In robotics and embedded contexts, memory layout directly impacts determinism, efficiency, and hardware interfacing reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Memory in a C program is divided into well-defined regions managed by the system or runtime.  
These regions include the **text**, **data**, **bss**, **heap**, and **stack** segments.  
Knowing how and when each is used helps prevent common bugs like segmentation faults, stack overflows, or memory leaks.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Text Segment:** Contains compiled code (machine instructions). Usually read-only to prevent accidental modification.
- **Data Segment:** Stores initialized global and static variables.
- **BSS Segment:** Holds uninitialized global and static variables, initialized to zero at program start.
- **Heap:** Dynamically allocated memory managed with `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
- **Stack:** Stores local variables, function arguments, and return addresses. Grows and shrinks with function calls.

## üß© Typical C Memory Layout (Process View)

| Region | Typical Purpose | Lifetime | Example |
|---------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Text (Code)** | Compiled program instructions | Entire program | Function definitions |
| **Data** | Initialized globals/statics | Entire program | `int counter = 3;` |
| **BSS** | Uninitialized globals/statics | Entire program | `static int counter;` |
| **Heap** | Dynamic allocations | Manual via `malloc/free` | `int *arr = malloc(100*sizeof(int));` |
| **Stack** | Function-local variables | Function scope | `int x = 5;` |

## üîç Memory Layout Example (Simplified)

From low to high memory (depending on architecture):

**[Text] ‚Üí [Data] ‚Üí [BSS] ‚Üí [Heap ‚Üë] ... [Stack ‚Üì]**

The heap and stack grow toward each other, and if they collide, it results in undefined behavior or segmentation faults.

---

## ‚ö° Key Behaviors

- **Static vs Dynamic Allocation:** Stack and global variables have fixed lifetime; heap allocations must be explicitly managed.
- **Alignment and Padding:** Compilers insert padding for performance and hardware alignment, affecting struct layout.
- **Pointer Arithmetic:** Operates directly on memory addresses ‚Äî critical in embedded and robotics applications where low-level I/O occurs.
- **Endianness:** Determines byte ordering in multibyte values, crucial when communicating with external hardware or networks.
- **Memory Mapping (MMU):** On embedded systems without an MMU, layout must be deterministic and often linker-script-defined.

## üìä Comparison Chart

| Concept | Memory Type | Managed By | Typical Lifetime | Access Speed | Example |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Stack** | Local Variables | Compiler | Function scope | Fast | `int n = 5;` |
| **Heap** | Dynamic Memory | Programmer | Manual | Medium | `malloc/free` |
| **BSS** | Static (uninit) | System | Whole program | Fast | `static int x;` |
| **Data** | Static (init) | System | Whole program | Fast | `int x = 3;` |
| **Text** | Code | System | Whole program | Read-only | Function bodies |

---

## üîß Alignment and Struct Packing

C structures may contain **padding bytes** to satisfy CPU alignment constraints.  
For example, a struct with an `int` followed by a `char` often has padding inserted to align the next variable properly.  
Use `sizeof()` and compiler attributes like `__attribute__((packed))` (GCC/Clang) to control this, though it can affect performance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Interaction with ABI and FFI

Memory layout consistency ensures binary compatibility.  
When using [[C ABI]] or [[C FFI]], the data structure layout ‚Äî including alignment, padding, and byte order ‚Äî must match across language boundaries.  
Mismatches lead to corrupted data or crashes when exchanging structs or arrays.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Debugging segmentation faults and invalid pointer access.
- Designing real-time robotics software with deterministic memory behavior.
- Interfacing directly with hardware registers or DMA buffers.
- Memory optimization in embedded devices with limited RAM.
- Cross-language communication through binary interfaces.

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths

- Predictable and transparent memory model.
- Enables precise control over hardware-level behavior.
- Supports deterministic timing in embedded/RTOS systems.
- Efficient for stack-based allocation.

---

## ‚ùå Weaknesses

- Manual memory management can cause leaks or corruption.
- Unsafe pointer arithmetic can overwrite memory.
- Platform-specific alignment differences can break portability.
- No built-in garbage collection.
