# venv

**venv** is the built-in Python module for creating lightweight, isolated virtual environments. It allows developers to maintain separate environments with their own installed Python packages and dependencies, preventing conflicts between projects and maintaining reproducibility.

---

## 📚 Overview

`venv` creates isolated directories containing a Python interpreter and site-packages, enabling multiple projects to run with different package versions on the same machine without interference. It is included in Python standard library (since Python 3.3), making it the most straightforward choice for Python environment management in many scenarios.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Virtual Environment**: Self-contained directory with its own Python interpreter and installed packages  
- **Isolation**: Separates dependencies per project to avoid global package conflicts  
- **Activation**: Script to switch the current shell context to the environment’s Python and packages  
- **Lightweight**: Does not duplicate Python binaries; uses symlinks where possible  
- **Compatibility**: Works across Windows, macOS, Linux  

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Managing project-specific Python dependencies  
- Testing multiple package versions side-by-side  
- Isolating dependencies for robotics scripts or AI pipelines  
- Ensuring reproducible development environments  
- Preparing lightweight virtual environments for CI/CD pipelines  

---

## ✅ Pros

- Comes pre-installed with Python (no external dependencies)  
- Lightweight and simple to use  
- Cross-platform support  
- No need for separate package managers  
- Ideal for most Python project isolation needs  

---

## ❌ Cons

- Limited package management (relies on pip inside the env)  
- Lacks advanced environment features of tools like `conda` (e.g., multi-language support)  
- No built-in environment sharing/exporting (requires manual `requirements.txt`)  
- Managing complex dependency trees can be cumbersome

- `python3 -m venv myenv` – Create a new virtual environment  
- `source myenv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) – Activate the environment  
- `myenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) – Activate the environment  
- `deactivate` – Exit the virtual environment  
- `pip install numpy` – Install packages inside the activated environment
