# asyncio

**asyncio** is a Python standard library module for writing concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax. It provides an event loop, coroutines, and tasks for asynchronous programming, particularly useful in I/O-bound applications like servers, robots, and data pipelines.

---

## üìö Overview

Introduced in Python 3.4 and standardized in 3.5 with the `async` and `await` keywords, `asyncio` is Python's official solution for asynchronous programming. It enables single-threaded concurrency by allowing the program to suspend execution of a task until an I/O operation completes, without blocking the entire process.

`asyncio` is commonly used in robotics for handling multiple sensors, servers, or event streams without needing multithreading.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Event Loop**: Core mechanism that runs and schedules coroutines  
- **Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def` and awaited with `await`  
- **Tasks**: Wrap coroutines to allow concurrent execution  
- **Futures**: Represent values that are not yet available  
- **await**: Waits for an asynchronous operation to complete  
- **async def**: Declares a coroutine  
- **asyncio.run()**: Entry point to run asynchronous programs

## üß∞ Use Cases

- High-performance web servers (e.g., FastAPI, aiohttp)  
- Asynchronous robot control loops  
- Streaming sensor data to cloud systems  
- Parallel data logging and event handling  
- Integrating with [[epoll]] for I/O multiplexing  
- Building async middleware for robotics APIs  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Lightweight concurrency model  
- Avoids thread locking and race conditions  
- Scales better than threading for I/O-bound tasks  
- Easy integration with modern web frameworks  
- Native to Python (no external libraries required)  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Steeper learning curve than synchronous code  
- CPU-bound tasks still require threading or multiprocessing  
- Debugging can be harder due to implicit control flow  
- Not compatible with all blocking libraries unless adapted
