# MicroPython

MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language optimized to run on microcontrollers and embedded systems. It brings the ease and flexibility of Python scripting to resource-constrained hardware, making rapid prototyping and embedded development more accessible.

---

## üß† Overview

Designed to run with limited RAM and flash, MicroPython enables developers to write clean, high-level code for devices like the STM32 series, ESP32, RP2040, and more. It includes a subset of the Python standard library and hardware-specific modules for GPIO, I2C, SPI, PWM, and others.

## üß∞ Key Features

- Python 3.4+ syntax and semantics (subset)
- Interactive REPL via serial or USB
- Hardware abstraction libraries for peripherals (GPIO, UART, ADC, DAC, PWM, I2C, SPI)
- Garbage collection and dynamic memory management
- Native code compilation support via `@micropython.native` decorator
- Support for asyncio-style concurrency (uasyncio)
- Built-in filesystem support on flash and external storage (e.g., SD card)
- Extensible via native modules written in C
