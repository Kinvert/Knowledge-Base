# Python

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, ease of use, and broad standard library. Widely adopted in robotics, data science, web development, embedded systems, and automation, Python is an essential tool in modern engineering workflows.

## üìö Overview

Designed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code clarity and rapid development. It supports multiple paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. In robotics and engineering, Python is frequently used for scripting, prototyping, data processing, and interfacing with hardware or simulation environments.

Python‚Äôs ecosystem includes thousands of libraries and tools for everything from machine learning to ROS2 robotics, making it a cornerstone in the open-source and scientific software communities.
