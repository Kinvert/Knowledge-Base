# NumPy

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is a foundational library in the Python scientific computing ecosystem. It provides efficient array operations, numerical routines, and tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code. In robotics and engineering, it is indispensable for data analysis, matrix computations, and vectorized operations.

## üìö Overview

NumPy offers a powerful `ndarray` object with broadcasting, slicing, and a suite of mathematical and statistical functions. It replaces native Python lists with more compact, performant arrays and allows for operations across entire arrays without explicit loops.

In robotics, NumPy is commonly used for sensor data processing, transformations, kinematics, and simulation. Many high-level libraries like [[OpenCV]], [[SciPy]], [[PyTorch]], and other Python tooling rely on NumPy arrays.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **[[ndarray]]**: A multi-dimensional array object  
- **Vectorization**: Replace loops with fast, element-wise operations  
- **Broadcasting**: Automatic expansion of arrays for operations  
- **Slicing**: Efficient access and manipulation of subarrays  
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix multiplication, decomposition, and solving systems  
- **uFuncs**: Universal functions operating element-wise on arrays

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Matrix math for SLAM and kinematics  
- Fast operations on sensor data streams  
- Image filtering and convolution  
- Signal processing and FFT  
- Geometric transformations  
- Point cloud preprocessing

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Extremely fast for numerical operations  
- Replaces many for-loops with vectorized calls  
- Interoperable with C, C++, and Fortran  
- Backbone of many scientific Python packages

## ‚ùå Cons

- Not GPU-accelerated (see [[CuPy]] or [[PyTorch]] for GPU support)  
- Static typing can be verbose or non-intuitive  
- Debugging broadcasted operations can be tricky  
- Limited support for sparse arrays (use [[SciPy]] for this)
