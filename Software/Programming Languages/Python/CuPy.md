# CuPy

**CuPy** is a GPU-accelerated array library that has an API nearly identical to **NumPy**, enabling drop-in acceleration of numerical and scientific computing tasks using NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs. It is widely used for high-performance computing, deep learning preprocessing, and GPU-accelerated robotics workflows.

## üìö Overview

CuPy lets you run NumPy-style code on GPUs with minimal code changes. It supports a wide range of functions: linear algebra, FFT, random number generation, indexing, broadcasting, and more. Under the hood, CuPy translates array operations into CUDA kernels for execution on the GPU.

For robotics and AI applications involving large datasets, real-time processing, or deep learning, CuPy can provide major performance improvements without requiring low-level CUDA programming.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **cupy.ndarray**: GPU array object analogous to NumPy's `ndarray`  
- **Device Contexts**: Manual control over which GPU to use  
- **Memory Pinned Transfers**: Faster host-to-device memory copy  
- **CUDA Integration**: Can directly run custom CUDA kernels  
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Many `numpy` functions work by replacing `import numpy as np` with `import cupy as cp`
