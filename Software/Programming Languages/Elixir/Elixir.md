# Elixir

Elixir is a functional, concurrent programming language built on top of the [[Erlang]] ecosystem. It runs on the [[BEAM]] virtual machine and leverages the robustness, scalability, and fault tolerance of [[OTP]] while providing a more modern syntax and tooling. Elixir is especially popular for distributed systems, web applications, and services that demand high concurrency.

## üìö Overview

Created by Jos√© Valim in 2011, Elixir was designed to make the power of Erlang/OTP more accessible. With a Ruby-like syntax, excellent tooling, and an active community, it brought renewed interest to the BEAM ecosystem. Its key strengths lie in developer productivity and its ability to scale fault-tolerant systems.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Actor model** concurrency inherited from [[Erlang]]
- **Immutable data** and functional programming
- **OTP behaviors** like `GenServer`, `Supervisor`, and `Application`
- **Metaprogramming** via macros
- **Hot code upgrades** and fault tolerance from BEAM/OTP
- **Phoenix framework** for high-performance web applications

| Language/Framework     | Concurrency Model       | Fault Tolerance | Primary Use Cases                  | VM/Runtime       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Elixir**             | Actor model (message passing) | Strong (OTP supervision trees) | Web apps, distributed services | BEAM VM |
| **Erlang**             | Actor model             | Strong          | Telecom, distributed systems       | BEAM VM |
| **Go**                 | Goroutines + channels   | Medium          | Cloud services, networking         | Native runtime   |
| **Node.js**            | Event loop              | Low             | Web apps, real-time services       | V8 Engine        |
| **Rust**               | Ownership + async/await | Medium          | Systems programming, concurrency   | Native           |
| **Akka (Scala/Java)**  | Actor model             | Medium-High     | Distributed event-driven systems   | JVM              |

## üèÜ Summary

Elixir combines the fault-tolerant power of Erlang/OTP with a modern and expressive syntax, making it attractive for web development, distributed systems, and embedded IoT projects. While it is not yet mainstream in robotics, its concurrency and resilience patterns are highly relevant to distributed robotic control and real-time systems.
