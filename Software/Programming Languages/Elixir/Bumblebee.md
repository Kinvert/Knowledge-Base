# Bumblebee (Pretrained Models for Elixir)

Bumblebee is a library in the Elixir ecosystem that provides access to state-of-the-art pretrained machine learning models. Built on top of [[Nx]] and [[Axon]], Bumblebee enables Elixir developers to load, fine-tune, and run inference on models from the [[Hugging Face]] Hub, all within the BEAM environment.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Bumblebee brings the power of modern AI models to Elixir, offering integrations for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and audio processing. It acts as a bridge between the high-performance numerical foundation provided by [[Nx]] and the functional neural network framework [[Axon]]. 

Through Bumblebee, developers can easily use models like [[BERT]], [[GPT-2]], and [[CLIP]] directly in Elixir applications.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Pretrained Models** ‚Äì Bumblebee hosts adapters for a wide range of pretrained models sourced from [[Hugging Face]].
- **Model Tasks** ‚Äì Supports text classification, tokenization, embeddings, vision inference, and more.
- **Seamless Integration** ‚Äì Works natively with [[Nx]] for tensor operations and [[Axon]] for network structures.
- **Serving with Nx.Serving** ‚Äì Enables deploying models in production-ready environments using [[Nx.Serving]] or [[Phoenix]] APIs.
- **No Python Dependency** ‚Äì Entirely implemented in Elixir for a consistent runtime experience.

## üî© How It Works

When you load a model with Bumblebee, it fetches its configuration, weights, and tokenizer (if applicable) from the [[Hugging Face]] Hub. The model is then instantiated as an [[Axon]] network and executed through [[Nx]] backends like [[EXLA]] or [[Torchx]].

For example, `Bumblebee.load_model({:hf, "bert-base-uncased"})` retrieves and compiles a BERT model for immediate inference in Elixir. Using `Nx.Serving`, you can expose this model as an API endpoint for production use.
