# BEAM (Bogdan/Bj√∂rn‚Äôs Erlang Abstract Machine)

BEAM is the virtual machine that runs [[Erlang]] and [[Elixir]] code. It is known for its lightweight process model, fault tolerance, and ability to handle massive concurrency, making it ideal for distributed and real-time systems‚Äîincluding robotics, telecommunications, and scalable cloud services.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The BEAM VM is the runtime at the heart of the Erlang ecosystem. It was designed for highly available, distributed systems where uptime and reliability are critical. [[Elixir]] builds on top of BEAM, inheriting its concurrency and distribution capabilities while providing a more modern syntax and developer experience.

BEAM‚Äôs architecture emphasizes isolation, supervision, and message passing‚Äîconcepts that allow applications to self-heal and scale seamlessly across nodes.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Lightweight Processes** ‚Äì BEAM spawns millions of concurrent processes, each isolated and managed by the scheduler.  
- **Message Passing** ‚Äì Processes communicate via asynchronous message passing, ensuring no shared memory.  
- **Fault Tolerance** ‚Äì Supervision trees and the ‚Äúlet it crash‚Äù philosophy make systems resilient.  
- **Hot Code Swapping** ‚Äì Code can be updated in a live system with no downtime.  
- **Distribution** ‚Äì BEAM nodes can easily form distributed clusters across networks.  
- **Schedulers and Preemption** ‚Äì Processes are preemptively scheduled, maintaining responsiveness under heavy load.  

---

## üî© How It Works

BEAM executes bytecode compiled from [[Erlang]] or [[Elixir]] source code. Each process runs independently with its own heap and garbage collector.  
Schedulers (one per CPU core) handle process execution using a preemptive model, ensuring fair CPU time distribution.  

When an error occurs, processes can be restarted by their supervisors, isolating faults and maintaining overall system stability.  
This supervision model forms the backbone of the [[OTP]] (Open Telecom Platform) framework.
