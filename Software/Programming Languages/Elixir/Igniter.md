# üß† Igniter

The **Igniter** framework is a code-generation and project-patching toolkit built for the Elixir ecosystem, especially within the domain of declarative frameworks like Ash Framework. It allows developers and library authors to automate tasks such as installing dependencies, generating boilerplate code, and applying codemods or project upgrades. In a robotics context, while Igniter isn‚Äôt robotics-specific, it can significantly streamline backend tooling, API scaffolding, upgrade scripts, and developer productivity in support services for robotic systems.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Igniter helps you manage your Elixir project‚Äôs lifecycle by enabling:

- Rapid scaffolding of new projects via `mix igniter.new`.
- Installing packages and automatically running installers via `mix igniter.install`.
- Refactoring and patching existing codebases using tasks like `mix igniter.refactor.rename_function`.
- Adding and composing custom generator tasks for library authors to integrate within user-projects.

While Igniter is not a robotics simulator or middleware, if you have a robotics application backend (for example built with Ash + Phoenix + Postgres), Igniter can automate setting up modules, APIs, data resources, or middleware integrations that support your robotic system.

## üß± Core Concepts

- **Installers** ‚Äì scripts/tasks that run after adding a dependency to a `mix.exs` and automatically configure the project. (e.g., `mix igniter.install ash`)  
- **Generators / Codemods** ‚Äì tasks that generate or patch source files; ideal for bootstrapping resources or upgrading code.
- **Upgraders / Patchers** ‚Äì tasks like `mix igniter.upgrade` that not only update dependencies but apply code changes to support new versions.
- **Composable Mix Tasks** ‚Äì Igniter tasks can be composed, chained, or extended by library authors to build custom workflows.
- **Project-Patching Framework** ‚Äì Beyond mere scaffolding, Igniter supports altering existing codebases (adding aliases, modifying modules, injecting code) rather than just fresh starts.

## üß© Use Cases

- Automatically generating module scaffolding for a robotics API backend built with Ash + Phoenix (e.g., telemetry endpoints).  
- Creating upgrade scripts for codebases interfacing with robotics middleware when underlying libraries change.  
- For library authors (e.g., robotics middleware integration in Elixir), building installer tasks to simplify adoption: `mix igniter.install my_robotics_lib`.  
- Patching existing projects to comply with new architectural patterns (e.g., migrate data layer, inject new behaviours) in a robotics services stack.

## üîß Key Features

- `mix igniter.install <package(s)>` ‚Äì installs dependencies and triggers installers.
- `mix igniter.new <app_name> --install foo,bar --with phx.new` ‚Äì create a new project with dependencies preinstalled and optionally tied into other generators.
- `mix igniter.refactor.rename_function <Old> <New>` ‚Äì example of built-in refactoring support.
- Easily write custom tasks for your domain: `use Igniter.Mix.Task` in your module to build your own generator/patcher.
- Versioned releases and maintenance (v0.6.30 as of Sep 2025) indicating active development.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Strengths

- Very powerful for automating repetitive scaffolding or maintenance tasks.  
- Composable design lets you build higher-level workflows.  
- Helps enforce consistent patterns and reduce boilerplate in Elixir projects.  
- For robotics backend stacks that adopt Elixir, it can speed up developer iteration.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Not robotics-specific ‚Äî the benefit in robotics comes only within Elixir backend tooling, not embedded control logic.  
- Requires familiarity with Elixir and its build toolchain (Mix, modules, macros).  
- Learning overhead if you haven‚Äôt created custom Mix tasks or code generators before.  
- If your robotics stack uses other languages (C++, Python, ROS, etc.), Igniter‚Äôs value is limited to the Elixir side.

- Explore how you might scaffold a robotics telemetry API: e.g., create resources like `TelemetryData` and generate endpoints automatically.  
- Study Elixir Mix task development: writing custom tasks with `Mix.Task` and integrating Igniter features.  
- Compare with other code-generation toolkits in other languages to extract lessons for robotics backend design.

## üìç Recommended Vault Placement

**Suggested folder path:**  
`Software/Tools/Backends/Igniter.md`

**Reasoning:**  
Although Igniter is an Elixir-tooling library rather than robotics-specific, in a robotics domain you will likely have a backend service layer (APIs, telemetry, orchestration) for which Igniter could scaffold modules and maintain code. Hence placing it under ‚ÄúSoftware ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Backends‚Äù is appropriate.
