# Phoenix Framework

The Phoenix Framework is a modern web development framework written in [[Elixir]], designed for building scalable, maintainable, and real-time applications. It emphasizes high performance, developer productivity, and fault tolerance through the power of the [[BEAM VM]]. For robotics engineers, Phoenix can serve as a backbone for dashboards, telemetry interfaces, and distributed control systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Phoenix provides an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture optimized for concurrency and real-time communication. It leverages Elixir‚Äôs lightweight processes and message-passing model to build systems that can handle massive concurrent loads efficiently.

Originally designed for web apps and APIs, Phoenix has found increasing use in IoT and robotics applications where real-time data, distributed communication, and fault-tolerance are critical.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Controllers & Views**: Define web request logic and rendering.
- **Channels**: WebSocket abstraction for real-time bidirectional communication.
- **LiveView**: Enables interactive, real-time interfaces without JavaScript.
- **Ecto**: Database wrapper and query generator integrated with Phoenix.
- **Supervision Trees**: Reliability mechanism from Elixir/Erlang for fault-tolerant systems.
