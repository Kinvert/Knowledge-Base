# Axon (Elixir Machine Learning Library)

Axon is a neural network library for the Elixir programming language, inspired by frameworks like [[Keras]] and [[PyTorch]]. It provides a composable and functional API for defining, training, and deploying machine learning models entirely in Elixir, leveraging the power of [[Nx]] (Numerical Elixir) for high-performance tensor operations.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

Axon is designed to bring deep learning capabilities to the Elixir ecosystem. Built on top of [[Nx]], it allows Elixir developers to build, train, and serve neural networks without leaving the BEAM ecosystem. Its design emphasizes functional composition, immutability, and integration with the concurrency and fault-tolerance features Elixir is known for.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Functional Model Definition** – Models are built by functionally composing layers (similar to how [[Keras]] models are constructed).
- **Immutability** – All data structures are immutable, consistent with Elixir’s design.
- **Backends via Nx** – Axon relies on Nx backends (such as EXLA or Torchx) for tensor computation.
- **Training Loop Flexibility** – Training loops can be customized using Elixir’s native process model.
- **Interop with Libraries** – Works seamlessly with [[Nx]], [[EXLA]], [[Torchx]], and [[Bumblebee]] for model definition, compilation, and deployment.

---

## 🔩 How It Works

Axon models are essentially computation graphs that describe how data flows through layers. These models are executed by compiling them into tensor operations handled by Nx. Training involves defining a loss function, optimizer, and update rules—all expressed in pure Elixir functions.

Developers can run training on CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs depending on the selected Nx backend (for example, `EXLA` leverages XLA for acceleration).
