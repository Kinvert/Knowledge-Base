# Zigler

Zigler is a tool that enables seamless interoperability between [[Elixir]] and the [[Zig]] programming language. It allows developers to write native Elixir NIFs (Native Implemented Functions) in Zig rather than C, offering improved safety, performance, and ease of integration. Zigler bridges the gap between Elixir‚Äôs high-level concurrent runtime and Zig‚Äôs low-level systems control ‚Äî making it a powerful combination for robotics and embedded applications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Zigler automates much of the boilerplate required to write NIFs for Elixir. By leveraging [[Zig]]‚Äôs safety features and build system, developers can write performant native extensions while maintaining memory safety and portability.

Instead of writing complex C code and handling BEAM integration manually, Zigler lets you define NIFs directly within your Elixir modules. It compiles and links the Zig code automatically during build time using Elixir‚Äôs `mix` tooling.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **NIFs (Native Implemented Functions)**: Functions written in native languages (e.g., Zig, C) and callable from Elixir for performance-critical tasks.
- **Zig Build System**: Used by Zigler to compile Zig code seamlessly during Elixir builds.
- **Zigler Macros**: Embedded Elixir macros define how Zig code integrates with Elixir modules.
- **Safety by Design**: Zig provides memory safety without a garbage collector, reducing the risk of crashes and undefined behavior in the BEAM VM.
- **Cross-Compilation**: Zig‚Äôs compiler allows cross-platform builds, enabling native Elixir extensions for embedded systems.

## üî© Use Cases

- Writing high-performance components (e.g., signal processing, kinematics, control loops)
- Integrating hardware drivers or low-level robotics libraries with Elixir
- Running Elixir code on embedded devices with Zig cross-compilation
- Building safe, performant FFI bindings for robotics middleware
- Extending [[Phoenix Framework]] backends with native modules for data handling or computation

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths
