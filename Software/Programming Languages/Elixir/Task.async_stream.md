# Task.async_stream

`Task.async_stream` is an Elixir function that enables concurrent processing of enumerable data while maintaining control over parallelism, fault tolerance, and result ordering. It‚Äôs a high-level abstraction built on top of lightweight Elixir processes, ideal for handling I/O-bound tasks or data processing pipelines in robotics systems that rely on concurrency for performance and responsiveness.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

`Task.async_stream` runs a function concurrently across elements of an enumerable. It spawns supervised tasks that execute the given function, yielding results as they complete. Unlike `Task.async` and `Task.await`, it manages multiple tasks efficiently, controlling concurrency via the `:max_concurrency` option.

Example usage:  
`Task.async_stream(list, fn x -> heavy_compute(x) end, max_concurrency: 4) |> Enum.to_list()`

This makes it well-suited for robotics workloads like batch sensor data processing, network communications, and running multiple simulations in parallel without overloading system resources.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Concurrency Model:** Built on lightweight BEAM (Erlang VM) processes.  
- **Enumerable Interface:** Accepts any enumerable (`List`, `Stream`, etc.).  
- **Supervision:** Tasks run under the current process; failures are isolated.  
- **Backpressure Control:** Limits the number of concurrent tasks via `:max_concurrency`.  
- **Timeout Handling:** Each task can be individually timed out using `:timeout`.  
- **Result Ordering:** By default, results are emitted in the same order as the input.

## üß© How It Works

1. The function iterates over an enumerable.  
2. Each element is passed to a worker task.  
3. The system manages concurrent task spawning and result collection.  
4. Results are lazily streamed, allowing for efficient resource use.  
5. When used with `Enum.to_list/1`, it gathers all results in order.

Example:  
`Task.async_stream(1..10, fn i -> compute_path(i) end, max_concurrency: 3, timeout: 5000) |> Enum.to_list()`

This executes up to three computations simultaneously while enforcing a 5-second timeout per task.

## üìä Comparison Chart

| Function | Concurrency | Ordering | Fault Handling | Backpressure | Typical Use |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Task.async_stream** | Parallel | Ordered | Isolated per task | Yes | Large data processing, I/O-bound tasks |
| **Task.async** | Manual | Manual | Manual | No | Ad-hoc concurrency |
| **Task.await_many** | Parallel | Manual | Crashes on errors | No | Small fixed task sets |
| **Flow** | Distributed | Ordered or unordered | Supervised | Yes | Dataflow pipelines, large-scale |
| **GenStage** | Distributed | Controlled | Supervised | Yes | Reactive systems and pipelines |
| **Stream.map** | Sequential | Ordered | Immediate | No | Simple, synchronous processing |

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

- Concurrent sensor data analysis across multiple streams.  
- Running perception modules in parallel (e.g., LiDAR, camera, and radar).  
- Parallel simulation of different path planning strategies.  
- Batch cloud API calls in fleet management systems.  
- Running concurrent diagnostics or hardware health checks.

## ‚úÖ Strengths

- High-level abstraction for safe concurrency.  
- Easy to control concurrency with `:max_concurrency`.  
- Maintains result order predictably.  
- Integrates seamlessly with Elixir‚Äôs `Stream` and `Enum` APIs.  
- Great for both CPU- and I/O-bound tasks (with tuned concurrency).

---

## ‚ùå Weaknesses

- Each task carries overhead of a separate process.  
- Not suitable for very short or trivial tasks due to process spawn cost.  
- Limited to single-node concurrency (use [[Flow]] or [[GenStage]] for distributed).  
- Exceptions within a task only propagate if explicitly handled.
