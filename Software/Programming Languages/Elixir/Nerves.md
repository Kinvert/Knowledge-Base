# Nerves

Nerves is a framework for building embedded systems using [[Elixir]] and the [[BEAM]] virtual machine. It allows developers to leverage the concurrency, fault tolerance, and distribution strengths of [[OTP]] for IoT devices, robotics platforms, and other embedded applications. Nerves streamlines cross-compilation, firmware management, and deployment, making Elixir practical for hardware-level work.

## üìö Overview

Nerves provides a specialized environment for creating and deploying **embedded firmware**. Instead of treating embedded systems as separate from general application development, Nerves brings the full power of the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem‚Äîfault tolerance, supervision trees, distributed messaging‚Äîinto the resource-constrained world of microcontrollers and single-board computers.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Immutable firmware images**: deployments replace the full firmware, ensuring consistency
- **Cross-compilation toolchains**: simplifies building for ARM boards and other hardware
- **Supervision trees**: fault tolerance for embedded processes
- **Networking support**: Wi-Fi, Ethernet, cellular integration
- **Minimal Linux-based systems**: built with Buildroot, tailored to embedded hardware
- **Remote updates**: supports over-the-air (OTA) firmware upgrades

## üèÜ Summary

Nerves bridges the gap between **embedded systems** and **fault-tolerant distributed computing**. By combining Elixir‚Äôs productivity with OTP‚Äôs resilience, it enables engineers to build IoT and robotic systems that are maintainable, scalable, and robust against failures. While not as widespread as [[ROS]], it excels in scenarios where reliability and remote deployment are critical.
