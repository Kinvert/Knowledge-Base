# Nx (Numerical Elixir)

Nx (Numerical Elixir) is a foundational numerical computing library for the Elixir ecosystem. It provides tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and just-in-time (JIT) compilation capabilities similar to [[NumPy]] and [[JAX]], enabling Elixir developers to perform high-performance numerical computation natively on the BEAM.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Nx brings numerical computing and machine learning primitives to Elixir. It provides a unified tensor interface and computation graph abstraction that powers higher-level frameworks such as [[Axon]] for deep learning and [[Bumblebee]] for pretrained model usage. Nx is designed for extensibility and integrates with hardware accelerators through pluggable backends.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Tensors** ‚Äì Multidimensional arrays that are the core data structure of Nx, similar to arrays in [[NumPy]] or tensors in [[PyTorch]].  
- **Backends** ‚Äì Nx operations can execute on different computation engines such as [[EXLA]] (XLA backend) or [[Torchx]] (LibTorch backend).  
- **JIT Compilation** ‚Äì Functions defined with `defn` can be compiled and optimized for performance on CPU, GPU, or TPU.  
- **Automatic Differentiation** ‚Äì Nx provides gradient computation support for building and training models (critical for [[Axon]]).  
- **Functional API** ‚Äì Immutability and composability are emphasized, consistent with Elixir‚Äôs design philosophy.

## üß© How It Works

Nx defines tensor operations in a backend-agnostic way. Computations written using `Nx.Defn` are compiled into optimized backend-specific code. For example, when using [[EXLA]], Nx compiles functions via Google‚Äôs XLA compiler, achieving performance similar to JAX or TensorFlow. 

Nx also supports native Elixir evaluation for debugging or environments where JIT compilation is unnecessary.
