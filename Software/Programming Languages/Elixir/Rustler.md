# Rustler

Rustler is a tool that enables seamless integration between [[Elixir]] and [[Rust]], allowing developers to write fast, memory-safe native code for use inside Elixir applications. It automates much of the complexity involved in creating NIFs (Native Implemented Functions), while preserving the fault-tolerance and safety of the [[BEAM VM]]. For robotics engineers, Rustler provides a powerful way to extend Elixir with high-performance computation, hardware interfacing, and real-time algorithms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Rustler bridges the gap between Elixir‚Äôs high-level concurrency model and Rust‚Äôs low-level performance and safety. By leveraging Rust‚Äôs ownership model and type safety, Rustler minimizes the risk of crashes or undefined behavior inside the BEAM. It‚Äôs ideal for performance-critical tasks where Elixir‚Äôs pure functional style might not be efficient enough ‚Äî such as control systems, signal processing, or computer vision routines.

Rustler automatically handles NIF registration, compilation via Cargo, and integration into `mix` builds, making native extensions feel like first-class citizens in Elixir projects.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **NIF (Native Implemented Function)**: A function implemented in native code (Rust, C, or Zig) and callable from Elixir.
- **Safe NIFs**: Rustler ensures Rust code doesn‚Äôt crash the BEAM by preventing panics and memory errors.
- **Term Encoding/Decoding**: Rustler provides macros for converting between Elixir and Rust data types.
- **Cargo Integration**: Rustler uses Rust‚Äôs build system to compile extensions automatically.
- **Mix Tasks**: The `mix rustler.new` task scaffolds new NIF projects with minimal setup.

## üî© Use Cases

- High-performance robotics computations (e.g., matrix math, SLAM preprocessing)
- Integrating Elixir with Rust robotics crates
- Writing real-time data pipelines or sensor fusion modules
- Extending [[Phoenix Framework]] APIs with optimized routines
- Creating safe hardware drivers for embedded robotics through [[Nerves]]

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths

- Memory-safe by design (prevents most segmentation faults)
- Automatic error handling ‚Äî Rust panics don‚Äôt crash BEAM
- Great ecosystem and tooling (Cargo, crates.io)
- Rich type conversions between Elixir and Rust
- Excellent documentation and active community

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Longer compile times compared to Zigler or C
- Requires understanding of both Elixir and Rust
- Slightly higher overhead for data exchange than C
- Less ideal for very small embedded targets (Zig may fit better)
- Async integration with BEAM is non-trivial without care
