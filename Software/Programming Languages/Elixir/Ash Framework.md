# üß© Ash Framework

The **Ash Framework** is an **Elixir-based, declarative application framework** designed to make it easier to build maintainable and flexible systems. It emphasizes **declarative data modeling**, **introspection**, and **extensible domain logic**, allowing developers to describe application behavior through configurations rather than ad hoc imperative code. In robotics and embedded systems, Ash can serve as a robust backend framework for managing data pipelines, configuration state, or REST/gRPC APIs connected to robotic middleware like [[ROS]] or [[DDS]].

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Ash abstracts common software patterns ‚Äî CRUD operations, authorization, policies, data validations, and resource relationships ‚Äî into a consistent declarative syntax. Built atop [[Elixir]] and [[Phoenix Framework]], it leverages the BEAM VM‚Äôs concurrency and reliability model, making it suitable for high-availability or distributed robotics control backends.

- Language: [[Elixir]] (Functional, Concurrent)
- Paradigm: Declarative, Extensible
- Primary Modules: Ash, AshGraphql, AshJsonApi, AshPostgres, AshPhoenix

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Resources:** Core data entities, similar to models in ORM systems. Each defines actions, attributes, relationships, and policies.  
- **Actions:** Declarative units of logic, such as `create`, `read`, `update`, or custom operations.  
- **Data Layers:** Abstract persistence backends (e.g., AshPostgres, ETS, or custom in-memory adapters).  
- **Policies:** Declarative authorization rules defined per resource or action.  
- **DSL (Domain-Specific Language):** Configuration syntax in Elixir to express relationships, attributes, and constraints.  
- **Extensions:** Plug-in style system to add new behaviors like GraphQL exposure or event sourcing.
