# Livebook

Livebook is an interactive notebook environment for the [[Elixir]] ecosystem, inspired by tools like [[Jupyter Notebook]]. It provides a web-based interface for running Elixir code, visualizing data, and documenting workflows in a reproducible way. Livebook is often used in areas such as machine learning, data visualization, and distributed systems development, making it valuable to robotics engineers exploring functional programming for concurrent systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Livebook is built on top of [[Phoenix LiveView]] and designed to run Elixir code interactively in a browser. Each notebook is a `.livemd` (Live Markdown) file that combines text, code cells, and rich outputs. It‚Äôs a great fit for interactive experimentation, documentation, and visualization within the Elixir ecosystem.

Key features include:
- Real-time collaboration
- Execution isolation via [[Elixir]] processes
- Integration with [[Nx]] and [[Axon]] for machine learning
- Portable notebooks saved as plain text (`.livemd`)

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Sessions**: Each notebook runs in its own session with isolated runtime.
- **Kino**: Visualization widgets used for rendering charts, tables, and controls.
- **Smart Cells**: Prebuilt notebook cells for common tasks (like data upload, plotting, or connecting to databases).
- **Live Markdown**: A Markdown dialect supporting embedded Elixir code and interactive elements.
- **Persistence**: Code and outputs can be stored and shared through `.livemd` files.
