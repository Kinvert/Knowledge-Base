# LiveView (Elixir Real-Time Web Framework)

LiveView is a web framework for [[Elixir]] that allows developers to build rich, real-time user interfaces without writing JavaScript. It leverages the [[Phoenix]] framework and [[BEAM]] concurrency model to push HTML updates over WebSockets efficiently, enabling dynamic applications with minimal client-side complexity.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

LiveView provides a server-rendered model for reactive web applications. Instead of running complex logic in the browser, LiveView keeps the state and computations on the server. When the server state changes, only the minimal HTML diffs are sent to the client over a persistent WebSocket connection. This approach reduces frontend complexity while maintaining fast and interactive UI behavior.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Server-Rendered HTML** ‚Äì All HTML is generated on the server, maintaining a single source of truth.  
- **WebSocket Diff Updates** ‚Äì Only changes in the DOM are sent to the client, improving efficiency.  
- **Stateful Components** ‚Äì LiveViews maintain state across user interactions without page reloads.  
- **Event Handling** ‚Äì Handles user events (`phx-click`, `phx-change`, etc.) on the server side.  
- **Composable UI** ‚Äì Supports reusable live components for modular interfaces.  
- **Integration with Phoenix** ‚Äì Fully compatible with [[Phoenix]] routing, templates, and channels.

## üî© How It Works

1. The client loads a standard HTML page rendered by [[Phoenix]].  
2. LiveView upgrades the connection to a WebSocket, establishing a persistent communication channel.  
3. User interactions trigger events sent to the server.  
4. The server updates the state, re-renders HTML, and sends only the DOM diffs back to the client.  
5. Client patches the DOM with the updates in real-time.  

This model allows complex interactivity without heavy JavaScript frameworks and fully leverages BEAM's concurrency for handling thousands of simultaneous connections.
