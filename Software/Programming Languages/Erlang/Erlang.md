# Erlang

Erlang is a functional, concurrent programming language originally developed at Ericsson for building scalable, fault-tolerant systems. It is particularly well-known in telecommunications and distributed systems, where reliability and uptime are critical. Erlang‚Äôs runtime system (the BEAM virtual machine) emphasizes lightweight processes, message passing, and fault tolerance through supervision trees.

## üìö Overview

Erlang is designed for **concurrency**, **distribution**, and **fault tolerance**. It enables developers to write applications that can scale across many nodes and recover gracefully from failures. Erlang is often used where continuous operation and real-time responsiveness are essential.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Actor model of concurrency**: computation is performed by processes that communicate via message passing.
- **Lightweight processes**: millions of processes can run concurrently, managed by the BEAM VM.
- **Fault tolerance**: ‚Äúlet it crash‚Äù philosophy combined with supervision hierarchies.
- **Hot code swapping**: supports upgrading code in running systems without downtime.
- **Immutable data**: functional style ensures predictability in concurrent operations.

| Language/Framework     | Concurrency Model       | Fault Tolerance | Primary Use Cases                  | VM/Runtime       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Erlang**             | Actor model (message passing) | Strong (supervision trees) | Telecom, distributed systems, messaging | BEAM VM |
| **Elixir**             | Actor model (built on Erlang) | Strong | Web apps, distributed services | BEAM VM |
| **Go**                 | Goroutines + channels   | Medium          | Cloud services, infrastructure     | Native runtime   |
| **Akka (Scala/Java)**  | Actor model             | Medium-High     | Distributed event-driven systems   | JVM              |
| **Rust**               | Ownership + async/await | Medium          | Systems programming, safety        | Native           |
| **C++ (with threads)** | Shared memory, threads  | Low             | High-performance systems           | Native           |

## üèÜ Summary

Erlang remains one of the most influential programming languages in the domain of **concurrent and distributed systems**. Its principles of fault tolerance, scalability, and ‚Äúlet it crash‚Äù philosophy have shaped the design of many modern distributed frameworks and languages, especially through the influence of the BEAM VM and OTP libraries.
