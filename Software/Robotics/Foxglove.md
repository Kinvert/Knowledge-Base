# ü¶ä Foxglove Studio

**Foxglove Studio** is a powerful open-source visualization and debugging platform built for robotics and autonomous systems. It serves as a modern alternative (or complement) to tools like [[RViz]] and [[rqt]] in the ROS ecosystem, supporting both [[ROS1]] and [[ROS2]] data formats, as well as other middleware and log-based data workflows.

## üß† What Is Foxglove Studio?

Foxglove Studio is a **desktop application** and web-based tool that allows roboticists to **visualize, inspect, and debug** real-time and recorded telemetry from robots, simulations, or logs. It provides a modular, highly extensible interface with customizable panels for viewing:

- Messages and topics (ROS, ROS 2, MCAP)
- 3D scenes
- Time-series plots
- Transforms (TFs)
- Images and camera feeds
- Diagnostics and health
- Logs and console output

---

## üì¶ Key Features

- **Multi-protocol support**: ROS1, ROS2, [[MCAP]] logs, custom WebSocket-based sources
- **Extensible plugins**: Add new visualization panels or data sources
- **Cross-platform**: Mac, Linux, Windows, browser
- **Cloud sync**: Optionally integrates with Foxglove Data Platform
- **Time synchronization**: Useful for debugging sensor fusion and perception issues
- **Live and offline modes**: View data in real-time or post-process log files
- **Multi-user collaboration**: Share layouts and diagnostics remotely

---

## üß∞ Common Use Cases

- Visualizing perception pipelines
- Debugging robot control logic
- Viewing camera and lidar outputs
- Monitoring system diagnostics
- Investigating edge case scenarios in simulation logs
- Logging and analyzing teleoperation sessions

---

## üîó Supported Formats & Integrations

- ‚úÖ ROS1 & ROS2
- ‚úÖ MCAP (log file format developed by Foxglove)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket bridge (custom or integrated into simulators)
- ‚úÖ [[Ignition Gazebo]] (via bridge or ROS2 integration)
- ‚úÖ Custom integrations via extensions and plugins
