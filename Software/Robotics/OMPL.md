# 🤖 OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library)

**OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library)** is a popular open-source library that provides implementations of many sampling-based motion planning algorithms. It is designed for robotics applications where the goal is to plan collision-free paths for robots in complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Written in C++ with Python bindings.
- Focuses purely on motion planning algorithms — it does not handle collision detection or visualization itself but integrates with other tools (e.g., MoveIt, ROS).
- Provides a consistent API to try out different planning algorithms interchangeably.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Wide range of planning algorithms: RRT, RRT*, PRM, KPIECE, SBL, EST, FMT*, and more.
- Supports planning under geometric and kinodynamic constraints.
- Compatible with external libraries for collision checking and visualization (e.g., FCL, RViz).
- Designed to integrate into larger frameworks (e.g., [[ROS2]]).
- Supports benchmarking of planners on the same problem.

---

## 🚀 Applications

- Robotic arm motion planning.
- Autonomous vehicle path planning.
- Manipulation and mobile robot navigation.
- Research and teaching of motion planning algorithms.

---

## 🏆 Strengths

- Extensive set of planners in one framework.
- Easy to compare different algorithms on the same problem.
- Active community and ongoing development.
- Highly modular; integrates well with other systems.

---

## ⚠️ Weaknesses

- Does not provide built-in collision detection or environment representation — requires integration with other libraries.
- More suited for developers/researchers than end-users seeking an out-of-the-box solution.
