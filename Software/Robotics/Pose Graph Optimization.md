# üìç Pose Graph Optimization

**Pose Graph Optimization (PGO)** is a core technique in **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ([[SLAM]])**, used to refine robot or camera trajectories by minimizing the global error across a graph of poses and constraints. It is particularly common in **Graph-Based SLAM**, where the robot's trajectory and map are represented as a graph.

---

## üß† Summary

- Models robot poses as graph nodes.
- Models spatial constraints (e.g., odometry, loop closures) as graph edges.
- Uses nonlinear optimization (e.g., Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt) to find the most likely configuration of poses.
- Widely used in back-end SLAM systems.

## üîß Graph Structure

- **Nodes**: Robot or camera poses (often 2D/3D poses like [[SE2]] or [[SE3]])
- **Edges**: Spatial constraints, typically relative pose measurements with associated uncertainty (covariance)
- **Error Function**: Sum of residuals between measured and estimated constraints
