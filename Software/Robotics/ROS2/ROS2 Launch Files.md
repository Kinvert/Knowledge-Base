# ROS2 Launch Files

ROS2 Launch Files are Python-based scripts used to start and configure multiple ROS2 nodes and subsystems simultaneously. They provide a structured way to initialize complex robotic systems by declaring parameters, remapping topics, and composing nodes dynamically at runtime.

---

## üìö Overview

In contrast to ROS1's XML-based launch files, ROS2 uses Python for its launch system, enabling logic, conditions, loops, and substitutions. Launch files often load parameters from YAML, start lifecycle-managed nodes, and configure namespaces, node names, and topic remappings.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Launch Description**: A Python function returning a `LaunchDescription` object with launch actions.
- **Nodes**: ROS2 nodes started by the launch file, possibly with parameters and remappings.
- **Parameters**: Passed inline or via YAML config files.
- **Substitutions**: Dynamic values like `LaunchConfiguration`, `PathJoinSubstitution`, etc.
- **Launch Arguments**: User-defined CLI arguments passed at runtime.

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Starting up robot software stacks (e.g., perception, control, navigation)
- Setting ROS2 parameters and topic remappings
- Launching simulation environments
- Managing multi-node distributed systems
- Conditional startup of components (e.g., camera only if available)

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Python gives expressive power (conditions, loops)
- Supports composable nodes and lifecycle management
- Can load YAML parameters and include other launch files
- Reusable and modular

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- More complex than ROS1 XML-style
- Debugging may be harder for new users unfamiliar with Python
- Dependency on launch-specific APIs (e.g., `launch_ros`)
