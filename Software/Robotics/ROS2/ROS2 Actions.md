# ROS2 Actions

ROS2 Actions are a communication mechanism in the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) designed for long-running, goal-oriented tasks that need feedback and the ability to be canceled. They combine elements of services (goal/result communication) and topics (streaming feedback), making them ideal for tasks like navigation, motion planning, or any operation that evolves over time.

---

## üìö Overview

An action is defined using an `.action` file with three sections: **Goal**, **Result**, and **Feedback**. The client sends a goal to the server, which processes it asynchronously and sends periodic feedback. The client can also cancel the goal if needed. ROS2 Actions use a combination of topics and services under the hood to implement this pattern.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Goal**: The desired outcome or task to be performed (e.g., move to a position).
- **Feedback**: Intermediate progress updates while executing the goal.
- **Result**: Final outcome once the action finishes (successfully or not).
- **Cancellation**: Clients can cancel active goals mid-execution.
- **Action Client & Server**: Nodes that send and execute goals, respectively.

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Robot navigation (e.g., move to a goal location)
- Arm manipulation (e.g., grasp or place an object)
- Autonomous docking
- Path following
- Object tracking or exploration tasks

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Ideal for time-consuming or interruptible operations
- Supports continuous feedback for monitoring
- Built-in goal cancelation and result reporting

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- More complex than services or topics
- Not ideal for high-frequency, real-time tasks
- Requires more boilerplate setup and understanding
