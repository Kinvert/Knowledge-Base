# ROS2 Publishers

ROS2 Publishers are part of the publish-subscribe communication pattern used in the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). A publisher is responsible for sending messages on a specific topic, while one or more subscribers receive those messages. This mechanism is ideal for distributing sensor data, state updates, or control commands in a decoupled way.

---

## üìö Overview

In ROS2, publishers are created within nodes and are associated with a specific topic and message type. They broadcast messages asynchronously, and multiple subscribers can receive the same data without needing to know about the publisher. This allows for modular, scalable robotic systems.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Topic**: Named channel for message exchange (e.g. `/camera/image_raw`)
- **Message Type**: Defines the structure of the data (e.g. `sensor_msgs/msg/Image`)
- **QoS (Quality of Service)**: Controls reliability, durability, and history of messages
- **Node**: Publishes data as part of its computational graph
- **DDS Backend**: ROS2 relies on DDS for real-time data transport

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Publishing sensor data (e.g., images, LiDAR, GPS)
- Broadcasting robot states or joint positions
- Sending control signals to actuators
- Sharing localization or mapping results
- Emitting system health or diagnostics data

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Asynchronous and decoupled communication
- Scales to multiple subscribers
- Fine-grained control via QoS settings
- Low latency, high-frequency supported

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- No built-in feedback or acknowledgment
- Not ideal for request-response patterns
- Subscribers may miss messages if not tuned properly with QoS
