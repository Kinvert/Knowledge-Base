# rqt

**rqt** is a Qt-based framework for GUI development in ROS and ROS2. It provides a flexible plugin-based architecture to visualize, debug, and control ROS systems through graphical interfaces. Engineers use rqt extensively for real-time introspection of topics, node graphs, parameters, diagnostics, and more.

---

## üìö Overview

rqt acts as a modular GUI platform with numerous plugins covering visualization (plots, images), diagnostics, node management, and parameter editing. It is written in Python and Qt, making it lightweight and extensible. ROS2 supports rqt with dedicated plugins compatible with the newer middleware.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Each feature (e.g., topic monitor, plotter) is a plugin loaded dynamically
- **rqt Core**: The main application hosting plugins
- **Plugin Types**: Visualization, diagnostics, node management, parameter editing, etc.
- **Integration with ROS**: Subscribes to topics, services, and parameters in real-time
- **Extensibility**: Custom plugins can be developed using Python and Qt

---

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Visualizing sensor data streams (images, laser scans)
- Inspecting node graphs and connections
- Monitoring and plotting topic data over time
- Editing and setting ROS parameters on the fly
- Debugging diagnostics and system health
- Developing custom control panels for robot subsystems

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Modular and flexible UI for various tasks
- Real-time visualization and interaction with ROS nodes
- Extensive ecosystem of official and community plugins
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Supports both ROS1 and ROS2 (with version-specific plugins)

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Can be resource-heavy depending on loaded plugins
- Requires some familiarity with ROS topics and message types
- Limited GUI customization compared to standalone apps
- Plugins sometimes lag behind latest ROS2 middleware features
