# ROS2 Services

ROS2 Services are a communication mechanism in the Robot Operating System (ROS2) that enable synchronous, request-response interactions between nodes. Unlike topics, which are asynchronous and one-way, services are used when a node needs to ask another node to perform an action and wait for the result.

---

## üìö Overview

A ROS2 Service defines a pair of messages: a **request** and a **response**. One node advertises a service (server), and another node calls it (client). This is ideal for tasks like parameter setting, device control, or querying state, where immediate feedback is expected.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Service Definition**: `.srv` file format with two sections: request and response.
- **Client Node**: Sends request and waits for response.
- **Server Node**: Implements logic to handle requests and send back results.
- **Blocking Call**: The client blocks until it receives a response or times out.
- **IDL**: ROS2 services are defined using Interface Definition Language (IDL).

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Controlling hardware devices (e.g., open gripper, reset sensor)
- Querying or setting parameters
- Requesting one-time computations or data (e.g., transform lookup)
- Managing state transitions in state machines
- Initiating or stopping processes (e.g., start mapping)

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Simple to implement and understand
- Ensures responses for requests (synchronous behavior)
- Great for command-response patterns

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Blocking by default (not suitable for long operations)
- Poor scalability compared to topics or actions for frequent events
- Fragile in unreliable or distributed networks
