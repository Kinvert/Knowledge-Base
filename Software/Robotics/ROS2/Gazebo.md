# ü§ñ Gazebo Simulator

Gazebo is a powerful open-source 3D robotics simulator that enables testing, development, and validation of robotic systems in virtual environments. It provides accurate physics simulation, sensor modeling, and interfaces with robotic frameworks like [[ROS2]].

## üîÑ Gazebo vs Ignition Gazebo (Fortress, Citadel, etc.)

Gazebo classic has been rebranded as **Gazebo Classic**, while a modern reimplementation known as **Ignition Gazebo** (now simply referred to as Gazebo under the new architecture) is the future-forward version with modular, scalable architecture.

| Feature | Gazebo Classic | Ignition Gazebo |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Architecture | Monolithic | Modular (library-based) |
| GUI | Integrated | Separate (`ign-gui`) |
| Communication | Custom | DDS / ZeroMQ |
| SDF Format | V1.6 | V1.9+ |
| Performance | Good | Improved (esp. with GPU support) |
| ROS Integration | ros_gazebo / gazebo_ros_pkgs | ros_ign_bridge (still maturing) |

## üìê Supported Formats

- **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format): Primary for ROS/ROS2
- **SDF** (Simulation Description Format): Native format for Gazebo
