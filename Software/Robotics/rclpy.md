# üü£ rclpy

**rclpy** is the official Python client library for [[ROS2]] (Robot Operating System 2). It allows developers to write ROS 2 nodes, interact with topics, services, actions, and parameters, and control the ROS 2 middleware from Python code.

---

## üß† Summary

- Provides Python bindings for ROS 2 core functionality.
- Enables rapid development and prototyping of robotics applications.
- Built on top of the underlying ROS Client Library (RCL), which interacts with [[DDS]] (Data Distribution Service).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes in Python.
- Publish and subscribe to [[ ROS2 Topics]].
- Define and call [[ROS2 Services]].
- Use [[ROS2 Actions]] for long-running tasks.
- Work with ROS 2 parameters.
- Integrate with QoS (Quality of Service) policies.

---

## üöÄ Example Use Cases

- Prototyping and testing algorithms quickly.
- Educational projects and teaching robotics.
- Scripting for robot control, logging, or monitoring.
- Lightweight nodes for system orchestration.

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Easy and quick to develop in Python.
- Ideal for prototyping and small applications.
- Access to the vast Python ecosystem (e.g., NumPy, OpenCV).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Slower performance compared to [[rclcpp]] (the C++ client library).
- Higher CPU usage may be noticeable in resource-constrained systems.
- Some ROS 2 features are first implemented in rclcpp and appear in rclpy later.

## üìä Comparison with Other ROS 2 Client Libraries

| Client Library | Language | Performance | Ease of Use | Notes                    |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| rclpy          | Python   | Moderate     | Easy        | Great for scripting, prototyping |
| [[rclcpp]]     | C++      | High         | Moderate    | Best for production-grade, real-time systems |
| rcljava        | Java     | Moderate     | Moderate    | Less common, industrial use cases |
