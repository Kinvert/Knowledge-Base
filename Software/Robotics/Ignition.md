# üöÄ Ignition Gazebo (Gazebo Sim)

**Ignition Gazebo**, now rebranded under the unified **Gazebo Sim** umbrella (https://gazebosim.org), is the next-generation simulation platform developed by Open Robotics to succeed the original [[Gazebo]] (now referred to as *Gazebo Classic*). It introduces a modular, scalable, and modern architecture built to handle advanced robotic simulation with enhanced flexibility, better performance, and long-term maintainability.
