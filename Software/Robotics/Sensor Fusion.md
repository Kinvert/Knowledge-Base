# 🔗 Sensor Fusion

**Sensor Fusion** is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate, reliable, and meaningful information than could be achieved using any individual sensor alone. It is fundamental in systems where no single sensor provides sufficient information or where redundancy improves robustness.

## 🧠 Summary

- Combines complementary, redundant, or cooperative data from different sensor types.
- Common in robotics, autonomous vehicles, aerospace, and IoT.
- Enhances accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and improves fault tolerance.

## 🌐 Techniques

- **Kalman Filter / Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**  
  For linear/non-linear systems with Gaussian noise.

- **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**  
  Handles higher non-linearities more accurately than EKF.

- **Particle Filters**  
  Useful for highly non-linear, non-Gaussian systems.

- **Complementary Filter**  
  Simple fusion of fast/noisy and slow/stable sensors (e.g. gyro + accelerometer).

- **Bayesian Networks / Probabilistic Graphs**  
  Model complex dependencies and uncertainty.

- **Deep Learning-based Fusion**  
  Emerging methods using neural networks for fusion tasks.
