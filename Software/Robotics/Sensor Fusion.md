# üîó Sensor Fusion

**Sensor Fusion** is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate, reliable, and meaningful information than could be achieved using any individual sensor alone. It is fundamental in systems where no single sensor provides sufficient information or where redundancy improves robustness.

## üß† Summary

- Combines complementary, redundant, or cooperative data from different sensor types.
- Common in robotics, autonomous vehicles, aerospace, and IoT.
- Enhances accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and improves fault tolerance.
