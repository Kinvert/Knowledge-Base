# üü£ MuJoCo

**MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact)** is a high-fidelity physics engine specifically designed for simulating complex dynamical systems with contacts, friction, and constraints. Originally developed by Emo Todorov at the University of Washington, MuJoCo is widely used in robotics, control theory, machine learning, and biomechanics research. As of 2021, it is maintained as an open-source project under the sponsorship of DeepMind.

## üìê Model Structure

MuJoCo scenes consist of:

- **Bodies:** The rigid bodies (links, world) in the system.
- **Joints:** Degrees of freedom (revolute, prismatic, ball, etc.) between bodies.
- **Geometries:** Shapes for collision detection and rendering (spheres, boxes, meshes, etc.).
- **Actuators:** Devices that apply force or torque (motors, muscles).
- **Constraints:** Limits and couplings between joints or between bodies.
- **Sensors:** Devices to measure forces, positions, velocities, etc.

## ‚ö° Strengths

- Very fast and efficient, suitable for real-time simulation.
- Accurate contact dynamics, with stable solutions even in challenging scenarios.
- Supports gradient-based methods with analytical derivatives.
- Highly flexible, allowing detailed models from low-level actuators to complex contact-rich environments.
- Wide adoption ensures good community support and integration with other tools (e.g. OpenAI Gym, Isaac Gym).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Steeper learning curve due to MJCF syntax and model complexity.
- Primarily designed for rigid-body dynamics (no soft-body or fluid simulation out of the box).
- Visualization is functional but lacks advanced rendering seen in engines like Unity or Unreal.
- Requires thoughtful tuning of contact parameters (e.g. friction, restitution) for realistic behavior.
