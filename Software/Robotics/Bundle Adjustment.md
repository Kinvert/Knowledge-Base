# üì∏ Bundle Adjustment

**Bundle Adjustment (BA)** is a key optimization technique in computer vision and robotics, particularly used in **SLAM**, **Structure-from-Motion (SfM)**, and **3D reconstruction**. It refines the 3D coordinates of observed points (landmarks) and camera poses simultaneously to minimize the **reprojection error**‚Äîthe difference between observed and predicted image points.

---

## üß† Summary

- Simultaneously optimizes **camera parameters** and **3D point positions**.
- Minimizes **reprojection error** across all views and points.
- Typically solved using **nonlinear least squares optimization**.
- Essential for high-accuracy 3D mapping and localization.

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Camera Pose**       | The 6-DOF position and orientation of the camera in space.                  |
| **Landmark**          | A 3D point observed by one or more cameras.                                 |
| **Reprojection Error**| The 2D distance between observed feature locations and reprojected points.  |
| **Jacobian**          | Matrix of partial derivatives used in nonlinear optimization.               |

## üîÑ Process Overview

1. Detect and match features across images.
2. Estimate initial camera poses and 3D point locations.
3. Construct the optimization problem:
   - Variables: camera poses and 3D points.
   - Constraints: observed 2D image features.
4. Use an optimizer (e.g. [[Ceres]], [[g2o]], [[GTSAM]]) to minimize total reprojection error.
5. Refine and repeat if needed.
