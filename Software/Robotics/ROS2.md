# ü§ñ ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)

ROS 2 is the next-generation version of the Robot Operating System (ROS), designed to support industrial, real-time, and production-grade robotic systems. It provides a modular and open-source software framework for robot development, enabling distributed computing, communication between components, and integration of various sensors and actuators.

## üß± Core Concepts

- **Nodes**: Executable units of functionality that perform computation.
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages (pub/sub).
- **Services**: RPC-style request/response mechanism.
- **Actions**: For long-running tasks with feedback and preemption.
- **Parameters**: Runtime configuration of nodes.
- **Launch System**: XML or Python-based launch files to run multiple nodes.
- **Middleware**: DDS handles real-time publish/subscribe transport layer.

## üîÅ ROS 2 vs ROS 1

| Feature | ROS 1 | ROS 2 |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Middleware | Custom TCP/UDP | DDS (Real-time capable) |
| Real-Time Support | Limited | Yes (RTOS, priority scheduling) |
| OS Support | Primarily Linux | Linux, Windows, macOS |
| Security | Minimal | SROS 2 (security layer via DDS-Security) |
| Modularity | Moderate | Improved modularity |
| Multi-Robot Support | Complex | Improved |
| Communication | ROS TCPROS | DDS / RTPS |

## üß¨ Middleware: DDS

ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) as its core communication middleware. DDS provides:

- Real-time guarantees
- Quality of Service (QoS) configurations
- Decentralized discovery
- Plug-and-play compatibility across implementations (Fast-DDS, Cyclone DDS, RTI Connext, etc.)

DDS allows ROS 2 to be used in mission-critical and safety-sensitive environments like autonomous vehicles and industrial robotics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Languages

| Language | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| C++ | Core implementation (`rclcpp`) |
| Python | High-level scripting (`rclpy`) |
| Rust | Community crates (`ros2-rust`) |
| Java | Experimental bindings |
| Others | C, Lua (limited), Go (experimental) |

## üîå Tooling

- **`ros2` CLI**: Manage nodes, topics, services, and parameters.
- **RViz2**: 3D visualization tool.
- **rqt**: Qt-based GUI plugin system for monitoring and debugging.
- **rosbag2**: Data recording and playback.
- **Launch System**: Manage node startup configurations.
- **Colcon**: Build system (replaces `catkin` from ROS 1).
- **DDS Tools**: Some DDS vendors (e.g. RTI) provide visual network analyzers.

## üîê Security

ROS 2 introduces optional security features via SROS 2:

- Encrypted communication (TLS)
- Node authentication
- Access control
- Logging and audit
