# 🟣 Sophus::SE3

**`Sophus::SE3`** is a C++ class provided by the [Sophus](https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus) library that represents 3D rigid body transformations using Lie group theory. It is widely used in robotics and computer vision applications, particularly in areas like [[SLAM]], [[Visual Odometry]], and [[Bundle Adjustment]], where working with rotations and translations in SE(3) (the Special Euclidean group in 3D) is essential.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Represents transformations in SE(3): rotation + translation in 3D.
- Uses Lie algebra (`se3`) for efficient computation of small increments and optimization.
- Built on top of [[Eigen]] for matrix representation and manipulation.
- Common in optimization frameworks such as [[g2o]] and [[Ceres]].

---

## 📐 Mathematical Background

- **SE(3)** is the group of all 3D rigid body transformations:
  - Combines rotation (`SO(3)`) and translation (`ℝ³`)
- Lie group properties enable exponential and logarithmic maps:
  - `exp()` maps from `se3` (vector space) to `SE3` (group element)
  - `log()` maps back from `SE3` to `se3`
