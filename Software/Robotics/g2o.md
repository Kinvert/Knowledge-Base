# üîß g2o (General Graph Optimization)

**g2o** is a C++ framework for performing graph-based optimization, widely used in robotics and computer vision, especially in problems involving **SLAM**, **Bundle Adjustment**, and **Pose Graph Optimization**. It allows users to define custom vertex and edge types to model complex optimization problems as graphs.

## üß† Summary

- Developed at the University of Freiburg.
- Short for **General Graph Optimization**.
- Extensively used in **SLAM**, **Visual Odometry**, and **Structure from Motion** tasks.
- Enables efficient optimization over nonlinear error functions using techniques like Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt and Gauss‚ÄìNewton.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

| Concept         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vertex**      | Represents an unknown variable to optimize (e.g., camera pose, 3D point).   |
| **Edge**        | Represents a constraint or observation involving one or more vertices.      |
| **Optimization**| Minimizes the error functions defined by the edges over the vertices.       |
| **Solvers**     | Supports various sparse matrix solvers (e.g., Cholmod, CSparse, Eigen).     |
