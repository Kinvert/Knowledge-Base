# üü£ cv_bridge

**cv_bridge** is a ROS (ROS1 and [[ROS2]]) library that facilitates conversion between ROS image messages (such as `sensor_msgs/Image`) and OpenCV image types (`cv::Mat` in C++ or `numpy.ndarray` in Python). It allows seamless integration of ROS imaging pipelines with OpenCV processing.

---

## üß† Summary

- Bridges the gap between ROS image message formats and OpenCV image data structures.
- Supports multiple encodings like `bgr8`, `rgb8`, `mono8`, `16UC1`.
- Available for both C++ and Python (via `rclcpp`, `rclpy`).

## üöÄ Example Use Cases

- Convert camera image topics for OpenCV processing (e.g., object detection).
- Visualize or modify ROS image messages in OpenCV before republishing.
- Apply computer vision algorithms directly inside ROS nodes.

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Simplifies image handling in robotics perception stacks.
- Well-supported and widely used in ROS ecosystem.
- Compatible with tools like [[RViz]] and [[Foxglove]] when republishing processed images.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Requires careful handling of encodings (e.g., mismatches between `rgb8` and `bgr8`).
- Performance overhead for conversion in high-frequency pipelines.
