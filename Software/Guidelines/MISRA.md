# MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association)

## üìù Summary

**MISRA** refers to a set of **software development guidelines** for the C and C++ programming languages, originally developed for the **automotive industry**. It aims to **ensure code safety, portability, and reliability** in embedded systems, particularly in **safety-critical applications**.

Originally developed by a consortium led by the UK‚Äôs Motor Industry Research Association, MISRA guidelines are now widely adopted across industries beyond automotive, including **aerospace, defense, rail, and medical devices**.

## üéØ Goals of MISRA

- Prevent **undefined or implementation-defined behavior**
- Eliminate usage of **dangerous constructs** in C/C++
- Ensure **predictable and maintainable** code
- Improve **tool-based static analysis compatibility**
- Encourage **readability and portability**

---

## ‚úÖ Typical Guidelines

- No dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`, etc.)
- Avoid recursion
- No use of `goto`
- Enforce initialization of variables
- Type-safe conversions and casts
- Avoid use of compiler-specific features

MISRA guidelines are broken down into:

- **Mandatory**: Must be complied with
- **Required**: Should be complied with unless a formal deviation is documented
- **Advisory**: Recommendations

---

## üß™ Compliance & Tooling

### Tools Commonly Used
- **Static analyzers** like:
  - Polyspace
  - LDRA
  - PC-lint / Flexelint
  - Coverity
  - CodeSonar
  - Cppcheck (partial support)

### Deviation Process
MISRA allows **documented deviations** when justifiable. The deviation must:
- Be formally documented
- Be reviewed and approved
- Not compromise safety

## üì¶ Use Cases

| Industry    | Use Case                            |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Automotive  | ECU firmware, ADAS control systems  |
| Aerospace   | Flight control systems              |
| Medical     | Device firmware                     |
| Rail        | Train control and signaling         |
| Industrial  | Robotics and PLCs                   |

## üß† Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Ensures safety and reliability
- Widely accepted in regulated industries
- Supported by many tools
- Promotes better coding practices

### ‚ùå Cons
- Verbose and restrictive
- Learning curve
- Can slow development if not managed well
- Some rules may feel outdated in modern C++

| AUTOSAR C++14  | Modern C++ safety             | Focused on newer C++ standards         |
| CERT C/C++     | Secure coding                 | Emphasizes security over portability   |
| ISO 26262      | Functional safety (process)   | MISRA complements ISO 26262 coding     |
| JSF++          | Aviation software guidelines  | More stringent, often military-related |
