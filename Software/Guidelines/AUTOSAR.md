# AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture)

## üìù Summary

**AUTOSAR** is a worldwide development partnership of automotive manufacturers, suppliers, and tool developers that aims to establish an open and standardized software architecture for **automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs)**. 

Its goals are to **standardize the software infrastructure**, enhance **reusability**, improve **modularity**, and **reduce development time** in automotive systems.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Origins & Consortium

- Launched in 2003 by BMW, Bosch, Continental, Daimler, Siemens VDO, and Volkswagen.
- Now includes over **300 partners**, including OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and tool vendors.
- Managed by the **AUTOSAR Development Partnership**.

## üß± AUTOSAR Architectures

AUTOSAR defines two primary platforms:

### 1. **Classic Platform (CP)**
- Focuses on **deeply embedded, real-time systems**
- Designed for microcontrollers
- Used for traditional ECUs (e.g., powertrain, chassis, body control)

### 2. **Adaptive Platform (AP)**
- Designed for **high-performance computing** and **complex applications**
- Runs on multi-core processors with **POSIX**-compatible OS (e.g., Linux or QNX)
- Supports applications like **autonomous driving**, **over-the-air updates**, and **V2X**

## üì¶ AUTOSAR Layers (Classic)

1. **Application Layer**  
   - Application-specific logic (e.g., cruise control)
2. **Runtime Environment (RTE)**  
   - Acts as middleware between application and BSW
   - Auto-generated
3. **Basic Software (BSW)**  
   - Services like diagnostics, memory, communication
   - Includes MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)
4. **Microcontroller**  
   - Hardware-specific layer

---

## üß© Adaptive Platform Key Concepts

- **Service-oriented architecture (SOA)**
- **Execution Management** to control startup/shutdown
- **Update and Configuration Management (UCM)**
- **Communication Management** via SOME/IP, DDS
- Use of **ARA::** namespace for services (e.g., ARA::Com)
