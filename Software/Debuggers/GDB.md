# GDB (GNU Debugger)

GDB (GNU Debugger) is the canonical command-line debugger for compiled languages on Unix-like systems (C, C++, Fortran, Rust, etc.). It lets you inspect program state (stack, variables, registers, memory), control execution (breakpoints, stepping, watchpoints), debug core dumps, attach to running processes, and script complex workflows. GDB is extensible (Python), integrates with `gdbserver` for remote/embedded targets, and is the backbone for many GUI/debugger front-ends and IDE integrations.

---

## üî≠ Overview

GDB attaches to an "inferior" (the program being debugged) and controls it via OS facilities (typically `ptrace`), debug symbols (DWARF), and dynamic loader hooks. It supports source-level debugging, assembly-level inspection, multi-threaded programs, remote debugging, and scripting. Modern workflows often combine GDB with helpers like `gdbserver`, `pwndbg` / `gef`, `gdb-dashboard`, or record-and-replay tools like `rr` for reverse debugging.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Inferior:** the program being debugged (local, remote via `gdbserver`, or a core file).  
- **Breakpoints:** stop execution at a location; can be conditional.  
- **Watchpoints:** stop when a memory location/value changes (hardware vs software watchpoints).  
- **Frames & backtrace:** function call stack; `frame`, `bt`, `up`, `down`.  
- **Registers & memory:** inspect via `info registers`, `x/` commands and modify with `set $reg=` / `set var`.  
- **Symbols & debug info:** DWARF symbols (`-g` at compile time) enable variable names, types, and line mappings.  
- **Non-stop & multi-thread:** control per-thread execution.  
- **Remote debugging:** `gdbserver` or remote remote targets (`target remote <host>:port`).  
- **Scripting & pretty-printers:** embed Python for automation and custom pretty-printers (useful for STL containers, etc.).  
- **Reverse debugging / recording:** either GDB's internal `record` (limited) or `rr` for robust reverse execution.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works (short)

- GDB uses OS debug syscalls (`ptrace` on Linux) to stop the inferior, read/write its memory and registers, and resume execution.  
- Breakpoints are normally implemented by writing a trap instruction (software breakpoint) at the target address; hardware breakpoints use CPU debug registers.  
- Source mapping requires debug symbols; without them you operate on addresses and disassembly.  
- For remote/embedded targets, `gdbserver` runs on the target and GDB connects over TCP/serial to control it.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Source- and assembly-level stepping (`step`, `next`, `finish`).  
- Conditional & function breakpoints (`break foo.c:42 if x>5`).  
- Watchpoints (data breakpoints) `watch var`.  
- Thread control (`thread`, `info threads`, `thread apply all bt`).  
- Core-file debugging (`gdb ./a.out core`), postmortem analysis.  
- Remote debugging via `gdbserver` and `target remote`.  
- Python scripting and plugin ecosystem (`pwndbg`, `gef`, `gdb-dashboard`).  
- Symbol loading/unloading, shared library handling (`set solib-search-path`).  
- Reverse debugging with `record` (and `rr` integration for robust record/replay).  
- Support for cross-architecture builds via `gdb-multiarch` and target-specific GDBs (`arm-none-eabi-gdb`).

## üîç Practical Tips & Patterns

- Always compile with debug symbols: `gcc -g -O0` for easiest debugging.  
- Use `-Og` for a compromise between optimization and debuggability.  
- Prefer `gdb-multiarch` or a target-specific GDB for cross-architecture debugging.  
- Use `rr` to record a failing run and then use reverse execution to find the root cause.  
- Use pretty-printers for complex types (STL, Rust, etc.) via Python plugins.  
- Strip debug symbols from deployed binaries to protect IP, keep `.debug` files to load in GDB.

## üèÅ Summary

GDB remains a fundamental tool for low-level debugging, forensic analysis, and embedded/remote debugging. Pair it with plugins (`pwndbg`, `gef`) and record/replay tools (`rr`) for advanced workflows, and use `gdbserver` or cross-compiled GDBs for embedded targets. Mastering the one-liners above will cover 95% of day-to-day debugging tasks; the rest is using Python scripting and plugins to automate the other 5%.
