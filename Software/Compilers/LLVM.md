# LLVM

**LLVM** (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. It is widely used to build compilers, analyzers, debuggers, and JIT (just-in-time) execution engines. LLVM provides an intermediate representation (IR) that makes it possible to optimize and compile code for multiple architectures, including CPUs and GPUs.

Originally designed for static compilation, LLVM now powers many projects like [[Clang]], [[MLIR]], and even runtime frameworks for languages such as Julia and Swift.

## üß† Overview

At its core, LLVM is a compiler infrastructure composed of libraries that support:

- Compilation to and from a common intermediate representation (IR)  
- Optimization passes at compile-time, link-time, runtime, or idle time  
- Backend code generation for many architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc)  
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation  
- Frontend flexibility (e.g., C, C++, Rust, Haskell, Swift)  

LLVM‚Äôs architecture is **language-agnostic** and **target-independent**, making it valuable across many domains including robotics, high-performance computing, and AI.

## üß™ Use Cases

- Building custom programming languages or domain-specific languages (DSLs)  
- Optimizing numerical computation kernels  
- Powering [[JIT]] and AOT compilers for scientific applications  
- Enabling runtime compilation in environments like [[TensorFlow]] or [[TVM]]  
- Robotics DSLs for control systems or simulation scripting  
- Simulation tools that benefit from dynamic optimization  
- LLVM IR-based intermediate pipelines in [[MLIR]]
