# FreeRTOS

FreeRTOS is an open-source Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) kernel for embedded devices, widely used in robotics, IoT, and automotive systems. It's known for being lightweight, deterministic, and easy to integrate into bare-metal microcontroller environments. While FreeRTOS can run standalone, it's often used in conjunction with platform-specific SDKs and HALs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

FreeRTOS (Free Real-Time Operating System) provides preemptive, cooperative multitasking capabilities for microcontrollers and small embedded systems. Developed by Real Time Engineers Ltd., and now stewarded by Amazon Web Services (AWS), it supports a large array of architectures (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, etc.) and is available under the MIT license.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Tasks**: Lightweight threads with optional priorities.
- **Scheduler**: Determines which task runs at any given time.
- **Queues**: Thread-safe data transfer between tasks.
- **Semaphores/Mutexes**: Synchronization primitives.
- **Timers**: Software timers for deferred execution.
- **Hooks**: Idle, tick, and malloc failure hooks for diagnostics.
- **Tickless Idle**: Low-power sleep mode integration.
