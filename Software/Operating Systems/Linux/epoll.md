# epoll

**epoll** is a scalable I/O event notification mechanism in the Linux kernel, designed to efficiently monitor large numbers of file descriptors. It is commonly used in high-performance servers, network applications, and embedded systems requiring asynchronous, non-blocking I/O.

---

## üìö Overview

epoll improves on older mechanisms like `select()` and `poll()` by avoiding the need to linearly scan file descriptors each time. Instead, it uses an event-driven interface where the kernel notifies the user process when I/O events are ready, drastically reducing CPU overhead and latency in applications that manage thousands of sockets or devices.

It operates through three system calls: `epoll_create1()`, `epoll_ctl()`, and `epoll_wait()`.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **epoll instance**: A kernel object tracking a set of file descriptors  
- **Edge-Triggered vs Level-Triggered**: Edge is more efficient but complex; level is simpler  
- **Event loop**: Application blocks on `epoll_wait()` until an event occurs  
- **File descriptors**: Can represent sockets, pipes, or other I/O streams  
- **Non-blocking I/O**: epoll is often used with non-blocking file descriptors

## üß∞ Use Cases

- High-performance web servers (e.g., NGINX)  
- Real-time communication systems  
- Robotics applications with many sensors  
- Industrial gateways interfacing with multiple devices  
- Network protocol stacks and asynchronous APIs  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Scalable to thousands of connections  
- Efficient kernel-level event dispatch  
- No need to repeatedly pass entire FD sets  
- Supports both edge and level triggering  
- Suitable for real-time and low-latency systems  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- Linux-specific (not portable to Windows/macOS)  
- Edge-triggered mode is complex and easy to misuse  
- Requires file descriptors to be set to non-blocking  
- Not compatible with all types of file descriptors (e.g., some special devices)
