# Keyring

A **keyring** is a secure storage system for credentials such as passwords, API tokens, SSH keys, and certificates. It acts as a credential manager, reducing the need to store sensitive information in plain text files or scripts. Both operating systems and programming environments provide keyring functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

- **Purpose**: Centralized storage for secrets in an encrypted vault  
- **Integration**: Accessed automatically by applications (browsers, package managers, system services)  
- **Cross-platform**: Different implementations exist on Linux, macOS, and Windows  

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Credential Store**: A database or secure vault that holds secrets  
- **System Keyrings**: OS-provided keyrings such as `gnome-keyring`, `KWallet`, or Windows Credential Manager  
- **Application Keyrings**: Apps like `pip` or `git` use the system keyring to store credentials  
- **Libraries**: Python provides the `keyring` library for accessing OS keyrings programmatically

| Platform        | Default Keyring           | Example Use Cases                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Linux (GNOME)   | `gnome-keyring`           | Network passwords, Wi-Fi, secrets  |
| Linux (KDE)     | `KWallet`                 | Browser passwords, app integration |
| Windows         | Credential Manager        | Windows login, app secrets         |
| macOS           | Keychain Access           | iCloud, app passwords, certificates|
| Python          | `keyring` library         | Store PyPI credentials, API tokens |

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Keeps secrets out of plaintext config files  
- Secure storage with encryption and access control  
- Integrated with OS authentication mechanisms  
- Widely supported across applications and programming languages  

---

## ‚ùå Cons

- System-dependent (different backends on each OS)  
- Some CLI/server environments may lack a graphical keyring  
- Requires additional setup in headless/CI environments
