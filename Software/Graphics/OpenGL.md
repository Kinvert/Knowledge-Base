# OpenGL

**OpenGL** (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform, open standard API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. It is widely used in CAD applications, simulations, virtual environments, and games. For engineers and roboticists, OpenGL is commonly leveraged in **visualization tools**, **simulation environments**, and **GPU-based computation** tasks.

Unlike proprietary graphics APIs, OpenGL is hardware-agnostic and supported by nearly all modern GPUs, including those from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.

## üß† Overview

OpenGL defines a set of functions that allow programs to render graphics to the screen or a buffer. It uses a **state machine** model where various configurations are applied before issuing draw commands. Rendering pipelines can be **fixed-function** (legacy) or **programmable** via GLSL shaders.

OpenGL is often wrapped by higher-level engines and tools in robotics and scientific computing environments.

## üß™ Use Cases

- 3D visualization in robotics simulators  
- Real-time rendering of environments in tools like [[RViz]] or Gazebo  
- Mesh rendering for point cloud and surface visualization  
- Displaying sensor data or SLAM outputs  
- GUI rendering in tools using [[Qt]] or [[GTK]]  
- Shader-based effects for data augmentation or GPGPU tasks
