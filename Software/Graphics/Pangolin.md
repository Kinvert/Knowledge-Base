# üü£ Pangolin

**Pangolin** is a lightweight, high-performance 3D visualization and GUI library designed primarily for use in computer vision and robotics applications. It provides a fast, [[OpenGL]]-based framework for rendering [[Point Clouds]], camera poses, meshes, and interactive widgets for parameter control.

---

## üß† Summary

- Created by Steven Lovegrove, Pangolin is widely used in [[SLAM]], visual odometry, and robotics projects.
- Offers easy integration with [[OpenGL]] for custom rendering.
- Frequently used in research for real-time visual feedback of 3D data (e.g., camera trajectories, landmarks).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Efficient 3D visualization (camera views, point clouds, meshes).
- OpenGL-based rendering.
- Simple GUI panel for manipulating variables (sliders, buttons, checkboxes).
- Built-in support for saving video recordings of the window output.
- Cross-platform: Linux, Windows, macOS.
- Minimal dependencies.

---

## üöÄ Example Use Cases

- Visualizing SLAM or visual odometry output in real-time.
- Rendering point clouds and camera poses in structure-from-motion systems.
- Creating lightweight GUIs for tuning algorithm parameters during runtime.

---

## üèÜ Strengths

- Extremely lightweight and fast.
- Easy to embed in custom C++ applications.
- Well-suited for real-time, interactive visualization.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Primarily C++ focused; no official bindings for Python or other languages.
- Less polished than full-featured GUI frameworks like [[Qt]].
- No out-of-the-box support for advanced GUI elements (e.g., menus, complex layouts).
