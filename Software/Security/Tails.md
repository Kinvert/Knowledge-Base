# Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System)

## üß† Summary

**Tails** is a **privacy-focused live operating system** that runs from a USB stick or DVD. Its purpose is to **preserve privacy and anonymity** by routing all Internet connections through the **Tor network**, leaving no trace on the host machine (unless explicitly configured to do so).

Tails is based on **Debian GNU/Linux** and is developed by an open-source community, with contributions from the **Tor Project** and privacy advocates worldwide.
