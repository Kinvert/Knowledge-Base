# Eigen

**Eigen** is a high-performance C++ template library for linear algebra, matrix, and vector operations, widely used in robotics, computer vision, and scientific computing. It provides efficient, expressive, and easy-to-use abstractions for matrix manipulation, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.

## üìö Overview

Eigen supports dense and sparse matrices, linear solvers, decompositions (e.g., LU, QR, SVD), and geometry modules (e.g., rotations, transformations). It is header-only, making it easy to integrate into C++ projects without separate compilation. Eigen is a foundational tool for implementing algorithms in robotics such as state estimation, SLAM, control, and optimization.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Matrix and Vector Types**: Supports fixed-size and dynamic-size matrices  
- **Expression Templates**: Enables efficient lazy evaluation and avoids unnecessary temporaries  
- **Linear Solvers**: Direct and iterative solvers for dense and sparse systems  
- **Geometry Module**: Supports transformations (translation, rotation), quaternions, and Lie groups operations  
- **Support for SIMD**: Optimized for modern CPUs with vectorization  
- **Header-only**: Easy to include and integrate
