# üî• PyTorch

**PyTorch** is an open-source machine learning framework originally developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). Known for its dynamic computation graph and Pythonic interface, PyTorch is widely used in research and increasingly in production for deep learning applications.

## üß† Summary

- **Type**: Machine learning / deep learning framework
- **Initial release**: 2016
- **Languages**: Python (primary), with C++ front-end support
- **License**: BSD (open source)
- **Core concept**: Uses dynamic computation graphs (define-by-run), allowing flexible model construction and debugging

---

## üéØ Main Features

- **Dynamic computation graph**: Build and modify models on the fly ‚Äî great for research
- **Tensor operations**: Similar to NumPy but with GPU acceleration
- **Autograd**: Automatic differentiation for gradient computation
- **TorchScript**: Serialize and optimize models for production
- **Strong integration**: Works well with other Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, etc.)

## üî¨ Common Use Cases

- Research and rapid prototyping in deep learning
- Computer vision (CNNs, segmentation, object detection)
- Natural language processing (transformers, RNNs)
- Reinforcement learning
- Time series forecasting
- Generative models (GANs, VAEs)
