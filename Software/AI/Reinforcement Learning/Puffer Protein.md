# Puffer Protein

**Puffer Protein** is PufferLib’s built-in automated hyperparameter and reward tuning engine—designed to optimize reinforcement learning configurations efficiently and intelligently during training.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Automates tuning of hyperparameters like learning rate, entropy coefficient, and reward shaping parameters.  
- Focuses on **performance and compute efficiency**, avoiding full-length runs per configuration.  
- Built for PufferLib’s high-throughput training pipelines running at 1M+ steps/sec :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- Designed to handle **noisy stochastic environments**, making it resilient to variance across runs :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Multi-Fidelity Optimization**: Uses partial training runs, similar to strategies in CARBS or Hyperband setups.  
- **Cost-Aware Sampling**: Balances exploration of hyperparameter space with compute/time budget considerations.  
- **Reward Tuning Integration**: Allows learning adjustment of reward coefficients alongside algorithmic parameters.  
- **Stability-Focused**: Built to reduce the variance impact common in RL training, tailored for PufferLib workloads :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Auto-tuning PPO, SAC, DQN agents across Puffer environments with minimal manual intervention.  
- Joint tuning of reward weightings in multi-objective tasks (e.g., balancing efficiency and safety rewards).  
- Rapid sweep testing across Puffer environments (like Ocean suite) with limited compute budgets.  
- Minimizing iteration time during prototyping and research phases.

---

## ✅ Pros

- Works out‑of‑the‑box within PufferLib CLI via `puffer sweep`.  
- Avoids exhaustive grid or random search thanks to cost-aware optimization.  
- Empirically effective on stochastic RL tasks—early results show surprising, "unintuitive" configurations :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- Resilient to noisy signal thanks to training short partial runs and stopping early.

---

## ❌ Cons

- Less flexible than standalone HPO frameworks like Optuna or Ray Tune.  
- Primarily integrated within PufferLib—limited for external frameworks.  
- May require familiarity with PufferLib’s CLI to fully leverage.
