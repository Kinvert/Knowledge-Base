# moolib

**moolib** is a lightweight, high-performance framework designed for distributed reinforcement learning and deep learning research. Developed by Meta AI, moolib emphasizes modularity, speed, and simplicity, offering tools to build scalable RL systems that work across multiple machines with minimal overhead.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Written in **C++ and Python** with a focus on fast, low-latency communication.  
- Designed for **multi-process and distributed training**.  
- Includes modules for parameter server synchronization, experience replay, and RL rollouts.  
- Particularly useful for running RL workloads across CPUs and GPUs with minimal friction.  
- Integrates cleanly with PyTorch-based training pipelines.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **RPC Communication**: Uses its own optimized RPC system for low-overhead interaction.  
- **Shared Memory Queues**: Efficient data exchange between actors and learners.  
- **Asynchronous Sampling**: Collects experience from many environments in parallel.  
- **Learner-Actor Separation**: Distinguishes between experience collection and policy optimization.  
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Emphasizes transparency and flexibility in experiment design.

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Large-scale distributed RL experiments (e.g. Atari, MuJoCo, or [[Puffer Environments]]).  
- Customizing RL pipelines where full control over communication and scheduling is needed.  
- Reproducible research on efficient parallel RL algorithms.  
- Building multi-agent or multi-node RL systems from scratch.

---

## ✅ Pros

- Fast, low-latency system ideal for fine-tuning performance.  
- Lightweight and modular; no massive dependencies or orchestration needed.  
- Tight integration with PyTorch and Python-based workflows.  
- Scalable across machines or just across cores for local parallelism.  

---

## ❌ Cons

- Less out-of-the-box support compared to [[Ray RLlib]] or [[Stable-Baselines3]].  
- Requires more manual setup for experimentation (scripting environments, config files).  
- Smaller community and fewer high-level abstractions.
