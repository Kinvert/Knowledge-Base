# PufferLib

**PufferLib** is a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) library designed to simplify and standardize the training pipeline across a wide range of RL algorithms and environments. Built with interoperability and reproducibility in mind, PufferLib provides modular abstractions for agents, environments, and training loops.

---

## üìö Overview

PufferLib acts as a compatibility layer for RL research and development, offering a unified interface that integrates popular frameworks such as PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3, JAX, and environments from OpenAI Gym, PettingZoo, and more.

It is particularly useful for comparing RL algorithms, creating custom environments, and managing reproducible pipelines in both single-agent and multi-agent settings. It also supports vectorized environments and batch rollouts‚Äîcritical for efficient GPU training.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Agent Abstractions**: A standard format to plug in different RL algorithms  
- **Environment Wrappers**: Compatibility layer for Gym, PettingZoo, etc.  
- **Training Pipelines**: Configurable and reusable training loops  
- **Vectorized Rollouts**: For efficient parallel data collection  
- **JAX and PyTorch Support**: Choose between backends depending on your needs

## üß∞ Use Cases

- Benchmarking RL algorithms on standardized tasks  
- Developing custom multi-agent environments  
- Accelerating RL research by reducing boilerplate  
- Comparing different backend frameworks (e.g., [[JAX]] vs [[PyTorch]])  
- Integrating with cloud-based or containerized simulation workflows  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Abstracts away environment and agent incompatibilities  
- Reduces boilerplate code  
- Supports both PyTorch and JAX backends  
- Facilitates reproducible RL experiments  
- Good integration with existing RL ecosystems

## ‚ùå Cons

- Less known than major frameworks like [[RLlib]] or [[Stable-Baselines3]]  
- Smaller community and ecosystem  
- Best suited for research, not production deployment  
- Documentation still growing
