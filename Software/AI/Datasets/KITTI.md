# üöó KITTI Dataset

**KITTI** is one of the most widely used datasets for developing, training, and benchmarking computer vision algorithms in autonomous driving and robotics. Released by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), KITTI provides real-world sensor data collected from a car driving in and around Karlsruhe, Germany.
