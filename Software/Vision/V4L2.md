# V4L2 (Video for Linux 2)

**V4L2 (Video for Linux 2)** is the Linux kernel framework and API that provides standardized interfaces for video capture, output, and processing devices. It is widely used in robotics, embedded systems, and computer vision applications to interface with cameras, capture cards, and video pipelines. On platforms like the [[Jetson Family]], V4L2 plays a critical role in accessing camera streams over [[NVCSI]].

## ⚙️ Overview

V4L2 extends the original Video4Linux API and provides user-space applications with unified access to video devices through device nodes such as `/dev/video0`. It abstracts hardware differences, offering developers a consistent interface to configure cameras, capture frames, and control video pipelines.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Device Nodes**: Exposed under `/dev/video*` for capture and processing.  
- **Controls**: API for adjusting brightness, exposure, gain, etc.  
- **Streaming I/O**: Supports memory-mapped, user pointer, and DMA buffer methods.  
- **Pixel Formats**: Handles a wide range (e.g., YUV, RGB, Bayer RAW).  
- **Kernel Drivers**: Each camera or capture device has a corresponding V4L2 driver.  
- **Integration**: Used by higher-level frameworks like GStreamer, OpenCV, and NVIDIA LibArgus.
