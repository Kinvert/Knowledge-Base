# üü£ FFmpeg

**FFmpeg** is a powerful open-source multimedia framework used to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter, and play nearly all types of audio and video formats. It is widely used in video processing, robotics (e.g., for encoding camera streams), machine learning datasets, and media pipelines.

## üß† Summary

- Command-line utility and underlying libraries for media handling.
- Supports most known video/audio formats.
- Provides capabilities such as video editing, format conversion, streaming, frame extraction, and real-time encoding/decoding.

## üíª Example Use Cases

- Extract frames from video for labeling:
  `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf fps=1 frame_%04d.png`

- Convert `.mov` to `.mp4`:
  `ffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4`

- Stream camera feed:
  `ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 http://localhost:8090/feed.ffm`

- Combine audio and video:
  `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4`
