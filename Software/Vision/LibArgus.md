# LibArgus (NVIDIA Camera API)

**LibArgus** is a low-level camera capture API developed by NVIDIA for Jetson platforms. It provides direct access to camera hardware using the ISP (Image Signal Processor) and is optimized for high-performance image and video capture on NVIDIA SoCs. It is commonly used in robotics, computer vision, and AI applications where precise control over camera streams is required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

LibArgus is part of NVIDIA‚Äôs multimedia framework on Jetson devices. It offers fine-grained control over camera sensors connected through MIPI CSI and enables advanced use cases such as multiple camera synchronization, low-latency streaming, and access to raw or processed image data.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **ISP (Image Signal Processor) Integration**: Utilizes NVIDIA‚Äôs on-chip ISP for image preprocessing (denoise, HDR, white balance).
- **Camera Capture Sessions**: Defines a pipeline from sensor to application.
- **Multiple Output Streams**: Allows simultaneous delivery of frames in different formats (e.g., YUV for display and RAW for processing).
- **Low-Level Control**: Provides access to exposure, gain, frame rate, and synchronization features.
- **Zero-Copy Buffers**: Optimized for GPU and CUDA pipelines without unnecessary memory copies.
