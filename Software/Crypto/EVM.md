# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is the decentralized computation engine that runs smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a deterministic, sandboxed environment for executing bytecode instructions, ensuring that all nodes in the network reach consensus on computation results. The EVM is sometimes described as a "world computer" ‚Äî a globally distributed virtual CPU and memory system governed by consensus.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The EVM is a **state machine** that processes transactions and updates the Ethereum state accordingly. Each transaction is executed as bytecode on the EVM, which operates independently of the underlying hardware or operating system of participating nodes.  
It ensures **consistency, security, and determinism** across all Ethereum clients, regardless of programming language or machine architecture.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Bytecode**: Smart contracts are compiled to EVM bytecode, a low-level instruction set similar to assembly.
- **Opcodes**: The EVM has about 140 operation codes, covering arithmetic, logic, stack management, and blockchain-specific operations.
- **Gas**: Each instruction costs a certain amount of `gas`, preventing infinite loops and allocating computational resources fairly.
- **Accounts**: Two types exist ‚Äî externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys, and contract accounts controlled by EVM code.
- **Determinism**: Every node must produce identical results for the same input.
- **Storage and Memory**: Persistent `storage` is expensive and written to the blockchain, while transient `memory` and `stack` are cheaper but temporary.
