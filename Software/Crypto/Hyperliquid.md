# Hyperliquid (HYPE)

**Hyperliquid** is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain and decentralized exchange (DEX) platform built for on-chain perpetuals, spot trading, and permissionless financial applications. It combines centralized-exchange-grade performance with DeFi transparency. Its native token is **HYPE**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Hyperliquid integrates three major components:

- **Custom Layer 1 Blockchain** ‚Äî Designed from the ground up using a bespoke consensus algorithm called *HyperBFT* for ultra-low latency and high throughput.  
- **On-Chain Order Book Exchange (HyperCore)** ‚Äî A fully on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) that supports spot and perpetual futures trading.  
- **Smart Contract Layer (HyperEVM)** ‚Äî An EVM-compatible runtime allowing third-party dApps to build directly on the platform and access shared liquidity.  

The goal is to create a **fully on-chain, high-performance financial ecosystem** that rivals centralized exchanges in user experience and speed.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **On-Chain Order Book (CLOB)** ‚Äî Unlike AMMs, Hyperliquid uses a centralized-style order book directly on-chain for efficiency and precision.  
- **High Throughput / Low Latency** ‚Äî Achieves sub-second block times and processes hundreds of thousands of orders per second.  
- **Unified Liquidity Pool** ‚Äî All builders and traders tap into one liquidity pool, eliminating fragmentation.  
- **HYPE Tokenomics** ‚Äî HYPE is used for gas, staking, and governance; part of exchange fees go toward buybacks.  
- **Permissionless Building** ‚Äî Developers can launch DeFi or trading apps using built-in primitives without needing separate AMMs or liquidity layers.

## üß≠ Summary

**Hyperliquid** merges the performance of centralized exchanges with the trustlessness of DeFi. It provides a low-latency, high-throughput, fully on-chain environment with EVM compatibility and unified liquidity. While still young, its approach to combining a purpose-built chain, order-book trading, and shared liquidity positions it as one of the most technically ambitious DeFi infrastructures today. Its success will depend on ecosystem adoption, security, and the balance between performance and decentralization.
