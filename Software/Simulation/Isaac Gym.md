# Isaac Gym

**Isaac Gym** is NVIDIA's high-performance physics simulation environment designed for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). It enables training hundreds to thousands of agents in parallel using GPU acceleration and is tightly integrated with PyTorch for efficient end-to-end workflows.

Unlike traditional simulators like [[Gazebo]] or [[MuJoCo]], Isaac Gym leverages both GPU-accelerated physics and neural network training to drastically reduce training time.

## üìö Overview

Isaac Gym provides a bridge between modern RL algorithms and high-fidelity physical simulation. It supports domain randomization, fast parallel simulation, customizable environments, and physics backends like PhysX. It allows researchers and engineers to build scalable, high-performance RL experiments that were previously infeasible due to CPU limitations.

Isaac Gym is part of NVIDIA's broader Isaac ecosystem, which includes [[Isaac Sim]] (more graphics-focused), but Gym is more optimized for RL.
