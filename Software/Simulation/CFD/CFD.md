# CFD

**CFD** (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is a field of numerical simulation focused on solving and analyzing fluid flow problems. It leverages numerical methods—often the finite volume, finite difference, or finite element methods—to solve the Navier-Stokes equations that govern fluid dynamics.

## 🌊 Overview

CFD is widely used in engineering disciplines such as aerospace, automotive, energy, biomedical, and robotics. It enables engineers to model how liquids and gases behave in environments that are too complex, costly, or dangerous for physical experiments.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Navier-Stokes Equations**: Core PDEs representing momentum and mass conservation in fluids  
- **Turbulence Modeling**: Techniques like RANS, LES, and DNS to handle chaotic flow behavior  
- **Mesh/Grid**: Structured or unstructured domains for discretizing space  
- **Boundary Conditions**: Inlets, outlets, no-slip walls, symmetry, etc.  
- **Solver Types**: Pressure-based, density-based, incompressible/compressible solvers  
- **Post-Processing**: Extracting velocity fields, pressure gradients, vortex structures, etc.

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Aerodynamic analysis (e.g., UAVs, drones)  
- Internal combustion and exhaust systems  
- HVAC and airflow modeling  
- Blood flow simulation  
- Underwater and marine vehicle dynamics  
- Thermal cooling analysis in electronics

## ❌ Cons

- Computationally expensive, especially for 3D and turbulent flows  
- Requires high-quality meshing and careful validation  
- Results are sensitive to numerical schemes and model assumptions  
- Complex to set up for multi-physics or moving-boundary problems
