# Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)

The **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)** is a numerical simulation technique for fluid dynamics that models particle distributions on a discrete lattice. Unlike classical Navier–Stokes solvers, LBM operates through mesoscopic rules—stream and collide—making it highly parallelizable, stable for complex boundaries, and popular in physics-based simulations. In Reinforcement Learning, LBM appears in environments requiring differentiable, efficiently simulated fluid dynamics.

## 🧭 Overview

LBM simulates fluids by evolving probability distribution functions (PDFs) across lattice nodes. Each PDF represents the likelihood of particles traveling along discrete velocity directions. **D2Q9**, the most common 2D lattice, uses nine velocities (including rest), enabling accurate modeling of incompressible flows with moderate complexity.

LBM is widely used in **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, **aerodynamics**, **microfluidics**, **porous media**, and increasingly in **machine-learning-accelerated physics** due to its simple and parallel structure.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Mesoscopic Approach**  
  Bridges microscopic particle dynamics and macroscopic Navier–Stokes equations.
- **Lattice Structure**  
  Space is discretized into a grid; the velocity set is fixed (e.g., D2Q9, D3Q19).
- **Distribution Functions (fᵢ)**  
  Each node stores PDFs representing particle movement in direction i.
- **Collision Step**  
  PDFs relax toward equilibrium using the **BGK operator** (Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook).
- **Streaming Step**  
  PDFs propagate to neighboring nodes along predefined velocity vectors.
- **Macroscopic Variables**  
  Density ρ and velocity u derive from PDF summations.
- **D2Q9 Model**  
  Uses nine discrete velocities: center, N/S/E/W, NE/NW/SE/SW  
  Balanced trade-off of accuracy, stability, and computational cost.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Initialize PDFs on a lattice grid  
2. Apply **stream-collide cycle** at each time step  
3. Enforce boundary conditions (bounce-back, Zou–He, etc.)  
4. Extract macroscopic variables  
5. Iterate until reaching steady or transient solution

This simplicity makes LBM highly GPU-friendly and attractive for real-time or RL-based fluid control tasks.
