# Mesh Generation

**Mesh Generation** is the process of converting continuous geometrical domains into discrete elements (e.g., triangles, tetrahedra, hexahedra) suitable for numerical computation or fabrication. It plays a central role in simulation, 3D modeling, computer graphics, CAD, FEA/FEM, CFD, robotics, 3D printing, and even medical imaging.

Whether simulating heat transfer, printing a prosthetic, or rendering a robotic part, mesh quality profoundly impacts accuracy, stability, and efficiency.

## 🧠 Overview

Meshes are essential for approximating complex geometries using simpler, computable elements. Mesh generation involves subdividing a domain into:
- **Nodes**: Points in space  
- **Elements**: Lines, triangles, quadrilaterals (2D) or tetrahedra, hexahedra (3D)  
- **Connectivity**: Topological relationships between nodes and elements  

Meshes may be:
- **Structured**: Grid-like, easy indexing, faster simulation but less flexibility  
- **Unstructured**: Arbitrary connectivity, adapts to complex shapes  
- **Hybrid**: Combines multiple element types for flexibility and performance

## 🧼 STL and 3D Printing Mesh Considerations

- STL format uses **triangular facets** to represent surfaces  
- Surface normals must be consistent for slicing/printing  
- Tools like [[MeshLab]], [[Netfabb]], and [[Blender]] can fix non-manifold or inverted meshes  
- Overhangs, supports, and print orientation require **mesh-aware slicing**  
- Remeshing helps with over-densified or poorly distributed triangles
