# Finite Element Method

The **Finite Element Method (FEM)** is a powerful numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) over complex geometries. It divides a large system into smaller, simpler parts called *finite elements*, solving local problems and assembling them into a global system. FEM is widely used in mechanical engineering, physics simulations, computational robotics, and multiphysics analysis.

## 🧠 Overview

- Based on discretizing a domain into small elements (e.g., triangles, tetrahedra)  
- Converts PDEs into systems of algebraic equations  
- Suitable for irregular shapes and material properties  
- Used for steady-state, dynamic, linear, and nonlinear problems  
- Applicable in structural mechanics, fluid flow, electromagnetics, thermal analysis, and more

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

- **Mesh**: Discretized domain composed of elements and nodes  
- **Element Types**: Triangles, quads (2D); tetrahedra, hexahedra (3D)  
- **Shape Functions**: Interpolate field variables within elements  
- **Stiffness Matrix**: Represents the system of equations derived from variational principles  
- **Boundary Conditions**: Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin for physical constraints  
- **Weak Formulation**: Reformulates PDEs to make them suitable for numerical approximation  
- **Assembly**: Global system formed by combining local element matrices
