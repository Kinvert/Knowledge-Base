# FEniCSx

**FEniCSx** is a modern, open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM). It is the next-generation version of the original FEniCS project, offering a complete rewrite with enhanced modularity, scalability, and performance for research and engineering applications.

---

## 🧠 Overview

FEniCSx consists of multiple core libraries:
- **UFL**: Defines variational forms
- **Basix**: Manages finite elements
- **FFCx**: Compiles UFL into low-level C++ kernels
- **DOLFINx**: High-level interface for mesh, function spaces, solvers, and I/O

Designed for performance and flexibility, FEniCSx supports complex geometries, MPI-based parallelism, and integration with scientific computing libraries like PETSc.
