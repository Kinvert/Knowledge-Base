# Box2D

**Box2D** is a 2D physics engine for games and simulations, providing realistic physical interactions like collisions, friction, restitution, joints, and rigid body dynamics. Originally written in C++, it has become a widely adopted open-source library used in game development, education, and lightweight robotics simulation.

In robotics and reinforcement learning (RL), Box2D often serves as a backend for 2D environments in simulators like [[Gymnasium]] (formerly OpenAI Gym), where its simplicity and determinism make it ideal for fast iteration and research.

## üß† Overview

Box2D simulates the behavior of physical bodies in two dimensions. It supports dynamic and static bodies, collision detection, joint constraints (e.g., revolute, prismatic), and forces like gravity. It's well-suited for environments where full 3D simulation is overkill or unnecessary.

Several bindings exist in other languages, including `pybox2d` (Python), `LiquidFun` (Google‚Äôs fork with particles), and `box2d.js` (JavaScript/Web).

## üß™ Use Cases

- 2D robotics simulations and control (balancing, locomotion, pushing)  
- Reinforcement learning environments (e.g. CartPole, LunarLander)  
- Prototyping physics-based interactions in education  
- Game physics for side-scrollers, platformers, etc.  
- Visualizing and debugging simple physics problems

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

- Rigid body dynamics (circles, polygons)  
- Collision detection and resolution  
- Joint types: revolute, prismatic, distance, gear, pulley, weld  
- Sleep optimization for inactive bodies  
- Time step simulation  
- Gravity and damping  
- Customizable physics properties (density, friction, restitution)
