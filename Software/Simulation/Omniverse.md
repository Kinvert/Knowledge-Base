# Omniverse

Omniverse is NVIDIA‚Äôs collaborative platform for real-time 3D simulation and design. It connects different 3D tools, physics engines, and AI frameworks into a unified environment. In robotics, Omniverse underpins [[Isaac Sim]], enabling photorealistic rendering, synthetic data generation, and digital twin creation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Omniverse provides a scalable, cloud-enabled platform that allows multiple users and applications to collaborate on the same 3D scene in real time. It is built around the [[OpenUSD]] (Universal Scene Description) format and integrates with physics, AI, and simulation frameworks.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **USD (Universal Scene Description)**: Foundation of scene interchange and collaboration.  
- **RTX Rendering**: Real-time, ray-traced, photorealistic visualization.  
- **Connectors**: Plugins that bridge Omniverse with tools like [[Blender]], [[Unreal Engine]], [[Maya]], [[SolidWorks]], etc.  
- **Simulation**: Support for [[PhysX]], robotics (via [[Isaac Sim]]), and industrial workflows.  
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user scene editing with real-time synchronization.  
- **AI & ML**: Integration with [[CUDA]], [[TensorRT]], and NVIDIA AI SDKs.
