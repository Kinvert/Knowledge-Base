# Isaac Lab

Isaac Lab is NVIDIA‚Äôs open-source, GPU-accelerated framework for robot learning, built on top of [[Isaac Sim]]. It streamlines workflows for reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and motion planning by providing modular APIs, pre-configured environments, and sensor-rich simulations designed for sim-to-real transfer.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Modular & Config-Driven**: Architected using a configuration system (Hydra-based) with modular ‚ÄúManager-based‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirect‚Äù workflows for defining tasks via components such as observation, actions, rewards, and randomization. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Built on Isaac Sim + Omniverse**: Leverages physics (PhysX), realistic rendering, USD scene representation, and sensor simulation from Omniverse/Isaac Sim.
- **Vectorized & Scalable Training**: Supports massively parallel environment training for accelerated RL on single or multi-GPU, multi-node, or cloud-based setups.
- **Rich Sensor & Robot Assets**: Comes with RTX-based cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, contact sensors, and a library of robot types and environments.
- **Unified Framework**: It replaces older NVIDIA toolkits like IsaacGymEnvs, OmniIsaacGymEnvs, and Orbit‚Äîencouraging migration to Isaac Lab.
