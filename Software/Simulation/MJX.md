# üü¢ MJX (MuJoCo eXtensions)

**MJX** is a high-performance reimplementation of the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine in **JAX**, designed for research in reinforcement learning, robotics, and differentiable physics. It is part of DeepMind's efforts to build **differentiable and composable** physics-based environments that integrate tightly with modern ML tooling.

---

## üß† Summary

- **MJX** stands for *MuJoCo eXtensions*.
- Rewritten MuJoCo simulator entirely in **JAX**.
- Focused on **differentiability**, **GPU/TPU acceleration**, and **just-in-time (JIT)** compilation.
- Allows **gradient-based optimization** directly through physics simulation.
- Designed for large-scale parallel environments and batch simulation.

---

## üöÄ Use Cases

- Differentiable physics simulations
- Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL)
- System identification and inverse dynamics
- End-to-end optimization pipelines in JAX (e.g., with [[Flax]], [[Haiku]])
- Robotics simulation and motion planning
