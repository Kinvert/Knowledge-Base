# OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description)

OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description) is an open-source framework originally developed by Pixar for the interchange, simulation, and rendering of 3D scenes. It provides a standardized way to represent complex virtual worlds with rich hierarchies, assets, and metadata. Within robotics and simulation domains, OpenUSD has become central to platforms such as [[Isaac Sim]], where it supports interoperability, scalability, and accurate digital twin creation.

## üß≠ Overview

OpenUSD defines a robust and extensible file format (`.usd`, `.usda`, `.usdc`, `.usdz`) for 3D data, along with an API for scene composition. It is increasingly recognized as a backbone for industrial-scale simulation pipelines due to its ability to unify workflows between DCC (Digital Content Creation) tools, robotics simulators, and visualization platforms.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Scene Graphs**: Hierarchical organization of objects and environments  
- **Composition Arcs**: References, payloads, and variants for flexible scene assembly  
- **Layering System**: Multiple USD layers can be composed to form a final scene  
- **Schema Extensibility**: Custom data models for robotics, materials, physics, or AI  
- **Interoperability**: Bridges diverse tools like [[Isaac Sim]], [[Blender]], and Omniverse
