# Simulation Visualization

**Simulation Visualization** is the process of interpreting and displaying the results of numerical simulations such as CFD, FEM, particle systems, or robotics behavior. It turns raw numerical output into intuitive and often interactive graphics, enabling insight, debugging, presentation, and further analysis.

## 🧠 Overview

This field intersects computer graphics, scientific computing, and data analytics. The visualization tools are crucial for understanding the behavior of systems modeled by simulations—whether they represent airflow, stresses in a robot arm, or reinforcement learning agent trajectories in a 3D world.

It includes both **real-time visualization** for live simulation feedback and **post-processing** after simulations are complete.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Visualizing fluid dynamics around UAVs or cars  
- Analyzing stress concentrations in mechanical parts  
- Debugging physics-based robotic simulators  
- Presenting results from multiphysics simulations  
- Viewing agent behavior in reinforcement learning or swarm robotics  
- Mesh and field visualizations (e.g., velocity, pressure, deformation)
