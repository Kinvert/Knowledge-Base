# PyBullet

**PyBullet** is an open-source Python module built on the Bullet Physics SDK, designed for real-time physics simulation and robotics. It is widely used in robotics research, reinforcement learning (RL), computer graphics, and virtual prototyping due to its simple API and fast prototyping capabilities.

Unlike heavier robotics platforms like Gazebo or GPU-accelerated environments like Isaac Gym, PyBullet is lightweight, CPU-based, and easy to integrate into standard Python workflows.

## üìö Overview

PyBullet offers collision detection, rigid body dynamics, inverse kinematics, soft body support, and even camera emulation. It provides bindings for URDF, SDF, and MJCF formats, making it compatible with many robotic models. It is popular in academia and industry for both teaching and research.

While PyBullet lacks native ROS2 integration, it's excellent for standalone simulations, fast experiments, and reinforcement learning pipelines.
