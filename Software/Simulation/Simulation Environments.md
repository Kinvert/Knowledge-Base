# Simulation Environments

**Simulation Environments** provide virtual testbeds for robotics, reinforcement learning (RL), and control systems. These environments allow engineers and researchers to safely prototype, validate, and train algorithms without the cost and risk of physical hardware. They are essential for tasks such as locomotion, manipulation, autonomous driving, and learning-based control.

This document serves as a top-level reference for simulation environments used in robotics, RL, and AI development. Many of these platforms integrate seamlessly with tools like ROS2, Gymnasium, and custom physics engines.

## üìö Overview

Simulation environments replicate real-world dynamics with varying levels of fidelity‚Äîfrom simple 2D tasks to complex 3D simulations with GPU-accelerated physics. They allow for rapid iteration, synthetic data generation, and closed-loop experimentation, all critical for modern robotics and AI development.

Many simulation environments support plugins, sensors, cameras, depth data, and even physics-based soft-body or fluid dynamics, making them ideal for research and development across a wide range of domains.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Physics Engine**: Simulates kinematics, dynamics, friction, collisions (e.g. Bullet, ODE, PhysX)  
- **Environment Wrapper**: Abstraction layers like Gymnasium or PettingZoo for compatibility  
- **Observations**: Raw sensor outputs or structured state data  
- **Actions**: Discrete or continuous commands that control the agent  
- **Rewards**: Feedback for reinforcement learning  
- **Reset/Step Cycle**: Standard control loop in Gym-style environments  
- **Domain Randomization**: Adds noise or variability for robust training
